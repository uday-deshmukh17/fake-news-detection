Kohli first toured Down Under in 2011 and faced a hostile reception from the Australian crowd but he reckoned that the aggression gradually transformed into respect. “Growing up, watching cricket as a kid when we used wake up early and watch Test cricket in Australia, you can see the ball flying off the pitch and the opposition in your face, and I used to feel, ‘Wow, if I will able to step up in these conditions and against this opposition, that’s something I could be proud of as a cricketer.’ That’s the motivation for me to watch all the greats of our game from either side. Guys like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, even Virender Sehwag, guys whom I really looked up to,” Kohli toldFox Cricketahead of the first ODI in Perth on Sunday. ALSO READ|I was catching up on life: Kohli opens up on long absence from international cricket “Even the Australian set-up, how they played their cricket and how they were in your face all the time, intimidating and taking the game on, that was something that really inspired me to come here and do the same. Early on, I found it was easier to watch on television than be part of that hostile environment, but I am really grateful to all those times because that shaped me as a cricketer and as a person as well. “That really tests your mental strength and resilience because once you start copping it from the crowd, you can’t escape, you’ve got to come back every day,” added Kohli, who got out for a duck on his return to India colours after more than seven months. Kohli remembered the chats he had with former England skipper Kevin Pietersen, with whom he shared the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) dressing room during the Indian Premier League (IPL), which helped him prepare for the Australian brand of cricket. “I didn’t understand it initially, to be honest. But guys like Keven Pietersen, who copped it before, told me something about Australia that you feel like they are at you the whole time, but at the back of their minds and hearts they really appreciate that you are standing up and playing that kind of cricket,” Kohli said. “So, don’t take it personally, don’t take it to heart. You just go out there and play competitive cricket. You will realise how good you are as a cricketer, and you will realise over a long period of time how it really shapes up and makes up mentally as a player. I have nothing but gratitude for those experiences as a player. The crowd being at me really brought out the best in me.” ALSO READ|Kohli’s much-anticipated return ends in damp squib Kohli said that under those trying circumstances, he had no option other than giving his ‘120 per cent’. “I had no option but to be 120 per cent. There was no chance I wasn’t gonna perform in this country, in these hostile conditions. So, I really had a good time here as a cricketer. Off the field, honestly, people have been so relaxed and so respectful. When I haven’t been competing, and you walk on the street and they see you, you can see that genuine smile on their face. So, I really enjoyed my time here [Australia].” Kohli, who has retired from T20I and Test cricket, and only plays ODIs now, said Australia has been a happy touring place for him. “It is always lovely to be back in Australia, a place where I have really enjoyed my cricket. Played some hard-fought cricket over so many years, so many battles, eventually, what I have realised through the course of the whole journey is that if you play your cricket competitively and hard enough, and even if you are in the face of the opposition, you gain their respect after a certain point of time. That’s the experience of coming here and playing in this country. “I had some good memories at this stadium. In general, I love coming to Perth, a really nice place, really relaxed, something that I really enjoy. Beautiful wickets to bat, the pace and bounce which I always enjoy,” he said.

(Image: AFP) The chroniclers of cricket in Australia, where Virat Kohli truly cemented his greatness, waxed eloquent after it dawned on them that he will no longer torment their bowlers in whites. In the news rooms Down Under, a collective sigh interspersed with cheers and applause flowed as their tormentor-in-chief for over a decade brought the curtains down on a glorious Test career on Monday. Recommended Stories “For Australians, there was fascination with Kohli for his combination of incredible batting skill and spikiness on the field that reminded many of their own,\" leading Australian daily Sydney Morning Herald said of the Indian icon. “Kohli’s first series in Australia, in 2011-12, was an unexpectedly lopsided romp for the team led by Michael Clarke. In spite of the 4-0 scoreline, Kohli showed more defiance than many of his older contemporaries, capping it off with a century in Adelaide. “He also gained some early infamy for flipping the bird at SCG spectators. “This was the start of a running battle with Australian spectators that ended when Kohli made sandpaper gestures to the same crowd on what became his final day as a Test cricketer in January this year,\" the newspaper said. The 36-year-old Kohli, India’s most successful Test captain, played in 123 Tests, scoring 9230 runs with 30 hundreds and 31 half- centuries at an average of 46.85. He will now only be seen in ODIs, having already retired from T20 Internationals last year after having a significant role in India’s World Cup win in the Caribbean. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) highlighted his successful run as India’s Test captain, which also included a historic series win Down Under. “His Test career will also be remembered fondly for his spell as captain between 2014 and 2022, winning 40 of his 68 Tests in charge to become the country’s most successful skipper in the format and fourth all-time in terms of victories behind South African Graeme Smith (53) and Australians Ricky Ponting (48) and Steve Waugh (41),\" ABC wrote in its tribute. Virat Kohli broke1.4 billion hearts with retirement announcement, read the headline of a piece in news.com.au. It said that the departure of the two titans Kohli and Rohit Sharma will be felt when Indian tour England later this summer. “Kohli has been the rock at the centre of India’s middle order for most of his career — and losing (Rohit) Sharma and Kohli at the same time is a major gut punch to the cricketing powerhouse. “The immediate departures of Sharma and Kohli add another layer of intrigue to the widespread reports of disharmony within the Indian dressing room during the team’s tour of Australia this summer,\" news.com.au concluded. Fox Sports said the absence of Kohli, alongside Rohit, will leave a “gaping hole\" in the Indian batting line-up. “… With it being an unstable time for the team, the departure of Kohli and his successor as skipper at the same time will leave a gaping hole off field as well as in the Indian top order, despite their struggles, ahead of a crucial series,\" Fox Sports said. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all Since making his Test debut in 2011, Kohli captained India to the world number one position in the format and fetched a historic series triumph in Australia in 2018-19.

Kohli’s first opportunity to represent India came in 2006 when he played for India’s Under-19 team. His senior international career took off soon after when Kohli made his one-day international debut against Sri Lanka in August 2008. The batting tyro had five ODI centuries before his Test career began (in 2011 against West Indies), and while it didn’t begin with the same success, his maiden century against Australia in Adelaide in 2012 proved a turning point in the longest format. On that same tour Kohli hit Malinga’s Sri Lanka for a stunning 133no (86) in Hobart, commencing what would become a phenomenal record in ODI run chases. When Kohli returned to Australia for the 2014-15 summer, he was primed for greatness - he hit 692 runs in four Tests (with four centuries), the most runs ever scored by a visiting batter in a four-Test series in Australia. With a dominant run in the mid-to-late 2010s, Kohli would rise to the top of the ICC’s batting rankings in all three formats, and have good stints at the top of all of them. His rise to captaincy was expected and he would lead his side in all three formats for close to a decade, from 2014 before handing it over to Rohit Sharma in 2022. Kohli had a prolific home World Cup in 2023 which included scoring his 50th ODI century against New Zealand in the semi-final, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar (49) with the most tons in the format. On a team success front, Kohli won the 2011 ODI World Cup and the 2024 T20 World Cup, announcing his retirement from T20 internationals immediately after the latter.

Writing in his column for 'ESPNCricinfo', Chappell, a former India head coach said Kohli's over a decade long career in the format that began in 2011, was a \"reign forged in grit, fire, and audacity.\" \"It closes the chapter on the most transformative figure in Indian cricket since Sachin Tendulkar; perhaps Kohli even eclipses him in terms of cultural influence and psychological impact on India's cricketing identity,\" Chappell wrote. \"Kohli, the incandescent heart of Indian cricket for over a decade, did not just score runs. He redefined expectations, challenged conventions, and symbolised the self-assured, unapologetic India of the 21st century,\" he added. The 36-year-old Kohli announced his retirement on Monday, declaring that he is walking away with a heart full of gratitude even though it was not an easy decision to make. \"Virat Kohli is the most Australian non-Australian cricketer we've ever seen,\" Chappell wrote.

Chappell said Kohli's exit from Tests marks a \"seismic shift in energy\". \"There was a time when Indian cricket, particularly overseas, bore an air of respectful submission - playing with technical skill, yes, but often with psychological inferiority. \"That changed in stages. Sourav Ganguly gave Indian cricket a new spine. MS Dhoni brought ice-cold leadership and white-ball dominance. But Kohli? Kohli lit the fire. He tore the script and authored a new one, where India was not just competitive abroad but expected to win,\" he explained. Crediting Kohli for single-handedly revamping India's Test approach as captain, Chappell described the aggressive right-hander as an exceptionally perceptive man. \"Where others reacted, Kohli anticipated. He saw innings before they unfolded. He lived the pressure before it arrived. \"Yes, Tendulkar was a genius. Yes, Dhoni was a master tactician and an ice-cold finisher. But in the grand reckoning of Indian cricket history, Kohli has been its most influential figure,\" he said. \"Why? Because he changed not just results but mindsets.\" Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Marvel was founded in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics , [ 3 ] and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics . The Marvel era began in August 1961 with the launch of The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee , Jack Kirby , Steve Ditko , and numerous others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years and decades, was solidified as the company's primary brand. Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man , Wolverine , Iron Man , Captain America , Hulk , Thor , Doctor Strange , Daredevil , Black Panther , and Captain Marvel , as well as popular superhero teams such as the Avengers , X-Men , Fantastic Four , and Guardians of the Galaxy . Its stable of well-known supervillains includes Doctor Doom , Magneto , Green Goblin , Venom , Red Skull , Loki , Ultron , Thanos , Apocalypse , and Galactus . Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe , with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City. [ 4 ] Additionally, Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics , twice from 1977 to 1987 , and again since 2015 . History Timely Publications Main article: Timely Comics Marvel Comics #1 (Oct. 1939), the first comic from Marvel precursor Timely Comics . Cover art by Frank R. Paul . Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Goodman, who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into the emerging—and by then already highly popular—new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of editor , managing editor , and business manager , with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother) [ 7 ] officially listed as publisher. [ 6 ] Timely's first publication, Marvel Comics #1 ( cover dated Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl Burgos ' android superhero the Human Torch , and the first appearances of Bill Everett 's anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner , [ 8 ] among other features. [ 5 ] The issue was a great success; it and a second printing the following month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies. [ 9 ] While its contents came from an outside packager, Funnies, Inc. , [ 5 ] Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company's first true editor, writer-artist Joe Simon , teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes, [ 10 ] Captain America , in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one million. [ 9 ] Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941. [ 3 ] [ 11 ] While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters, some notable heroes—many of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer , Miss America , the Destroyer , the original Vision , and the Angel . Timely also published one of humor cartoonist Basil Wolverton 's best-known features, \" Powerhouse Pepper \", [ 12 ] [ 13 ] as well as a line of children's talking animal comics featuring characters like Super Rabbit and the duo Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal .

It is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $32.4 billion at the global box office. This includes Avengers: Endgame , which became the highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release. The films are written and directed by various individuals and feature large, often ensemble , casts.

Other individuals have also produced select MCU films, including Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk ; Amy Pascal for the Spider-Man films ; Lauren Shuler Donner , Ryan Reynolds , and Shawn Levy for Deadpool & Wolverine ; and Anthony and Joe Russo for Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars . Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called \"Phases\". Its first film is Iron Man (2008), which was distributed by Paramount Pictures . Paramount also distributed Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), while Universal Pictures distributed The Incredible Hulk (2008), which was co-produced by Hurd's production company Valhalla Motion Pictures .

Now, on to if you want to watch the MCU chronologically in-universe. So while Iron Man , set and released in 2008, can claim the banner as the first of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, within its story, Chris Evans has got Robert Downey Jr. beat. That’s because Evans’ origin story as Captain America in The First Avenger takes action in 1942. There, we’re also first fully introduced to the Tessarect, an energy cube that initializes the Infinity Saga, climaxing in 2019’s Avengers: Endgame . The next movie set in the timeline is Captain Marvel , the blockbuster with a Blockbuster, set in 1995 with Brie Larson starring as the cosmic Carol Danvers. And then it’s time to hit the start with Iron Man and RDJ’s world-making turn as Tony Stark. The movies can be seen in release order after that, except for 2021’s Black Widow , which is set in the aftermath of 2016’s Captain America: Civil War . Through the epic finale of Endgame (which essentially completed the first 3 phases of the MCU), there was a forward time jump of 5 years, placing most everything in Phase 4 and onward in the near future. Phase 4 started at the movies with Shang-Chi , and has been inviting its lineup of series to really do some heavy lifting, with Loki , Wandavision , Falcon and the Winter Soldier , and Hawkeye pushing the story forward. Then there was the gigantic one-two Spider-Man punch with Far From Home and No Way Home . Moon Knight , Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness , and now Thor: Love and Thunder are all set chronologically by release after that. And now, we’ve added Deadpool & Wolverine , Captain America: Brave New World , and Thunderbolts* . So if you want to watch the MCU by release order, the list above is your guide. But if you want to take an alternate route and see the movies chronologically within its own timeline (including the TV shows), check out our guide below!

Contents Avengers: Doomsday has a 2026 release date, and after some turbulence, a new title and villain. Robert Downey Jr. is back in the MCU, but not as Iron Man. San Diego Comic-Con 2024 was a feast for superhero movies . Marvel’s Phase 6 , which has been in trouble since Kang the Conqueror was scrapped as Thanos’ successor, has put the wind back in its sails. New movies like The Marvels, Ant-Man 3, and the upcoming Fantastic Four : First Steps have paved the way for the next big MCU crossover event to varying degrees of success, but The Russo Brothers are back to work their magic. Below are all the latest updates on Avengers: Doomsday. Avengers: Doomsday release date Avengers: Doomsday will be released on December 18, 2026 . The release date was originally May 2, 2025, but Disney pushed it back in June 2023 amid a slew of major changes to upcoming Marvel movies and TV shows . Then, the film was met with another delay soon after filming kicked off in March, 2025. In fact, both Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars were pushed back equally. They’re still set to launch exactly a year apart, though rather than in May, they’re not coming in December. It’s the third of four confirmed movies in Phase 6, after Deadpool 3 and Fantastic Four, and before Avengers Secret Wars on December 17, 2027. It was set to be directed by Daniel Destin Cretton, but Deadline broke the news in November 2023 that he stepped down to focus on other MCU projects, including Shang-Chi 2 and the Wonder Man series. Cast details Robert Downey Jr. returns to the MCU as Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday cast, alongside a massive roster of stars – including some old faces from the Fox-verse.

However, the actor quickly backtracked on these comments, following up and revealing, “I am in the next one.” He later added, “Don’t ever believe anything I say,” in keeping with the Marvel tradition to avoid spoilers at all costs. Brie Larson is keeping her cards close to her chest regarding Captain Marvel’s involvement, as when asked directly about her participation on The View, she told the host, “Thanks you for asking, and you know I can’t answer.” One character fans won’t see in Doomsday is the Scarlet Witch. According to Elizabeth Olsen herself , she’s not flying over to London for the back-to-back filming of both upcoming Avengers flicks. Instead, she’s taking time to film a pilot episode for a new FX series (unless she’s bluffing). As for people who might show up, earlier reports suggested Chris Evans will return, but it’s unclear if he’ll play Steve Rogers or another role entirely (after all, he did play Johnny Storm again in Deadpool & Wolverine ). Speaking of Steve, it was also reported in December 2024 that Hayley Atwell would be returning as his beloved Agent Carter (though Marvel has yet to confirm this). Downey Jr.’s return announcement wasn’t good news in everyone’s eyes , but Phase 6 now has potent OG Avenger energy. “New mask, same task.” Robert Downey Jr. surprises Hall H to announce his return to the MCU as Doctor Doom. pic.twitter.com/j1SEjzse3p — Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) July 28, 2024 Jonathan Majors has been dismissed as the overarching supervillain of this phase, Kang. On December 18, 2023 Majors was found guilty of assault and was dropped from the MCU. One report from Deadline claimed up to 60 superheroes are involved.

But the Marvel Cinematic Universe is set to make a thunderous return in 2025. A whopping nine MCU feature films and TV series are slated to arrive in movie theaters and on Disney Plus this year. Believe it or not, that's the calm before the storm. As announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2024 , Marvel has two retooled, newly Kang-less Avengers films coming in the next few years, which will see Robert Downey, Jr. starring in MCU movies again — but in a very different role, as the villainous Doctor Doom. Disney CEO Bob Iger laid out a plan to reduce Marvel Studios’ output and focus on quality, but that doesn't seem to be affecting the numbers just yet. Marvel is still committed to big super-team tentpoles, more Spider-Man movies, and getting some fresh blood into the MCU with characters like Wonder Man. Marvel Studios’ current plans stretch out until at least the middle of 2027. From the introduction of the Fantastic Four to the return of Daredevil in his first official MCU TV series, here’s every planned future Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and Disney Plus show. 2025 Ironheart: June 24 After taking her opening bow in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever , Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) gets her own series with Ironheart. The character is a brilliant young engineer who makes her own power suit, much like Iron Man’s, after reverse-engineering some of Tony Stark’s tech. Facing off against Riri will be The Hood (Anthony Ramos), a more magic-based villain. Rounding out the cast are Lyric Ross, Alden Ehrenreich, Regan Aliyah, Manny Montana, Matthew Elam, and Anji White. The Fantastic Four: First Steps: July 25 The MCU’s Phase 6 begins with the most hotly anticipated Marvel Studios debut this side of the X-Men, The Fantastic Four: First Steps . The fourth time is hopefully the charm for Marvel’s First Family, who have long suffered from lackluster cinematic adaptations. Spider-Man: No Way Home ’s Jon Watts was originally set to direct, but after his departure, WandaVision and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia director Matt Shakman stepped into the role. The Last of Us’ Pedro Pascal will lead the cast as the stretchy Mister Fantastic; Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Fallout) will be the force-field-manifesting Invisible Woman; Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) stars as the Human Torch; and The Bear’s Ebon Moss-Bachrach will embody the Thing. Joining our heroes are Ralph Ineson as Galactus , Julia Garner as Shalla-Bal, Natasha Lyonne, and John Malkovich . Eyes of Wakanda: Aug. 6 Image: Marvel Studios Originally pitched as an origin story series for Danai Gurira’s Okoye, leader of the Dora Milaje, Eyes of Wakanda is an animated series following the history of Wakanda, as seen through the eyes of warriors tasked with safeguarding the country’s miraculous metal, vibranium. Gurira is attached to reprise her role. This is the first TV series in the MCU’s Phase 6 rollout. Marvel Zombies: October Image: Marvel Studios Marvel’s Zombies alternate reality — previously explored in an episode of What If…? in season 1 and based on the 2005 Robert Kirkman comic — gets a four-episode miniseries in 2025, just in time for Halloween. Marvel Zombies will feature a bunch of Phase 4 heroes, like Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel, Kate Bishop/Hawkeye, and Shang-Chi, fending off zombified versions of the Avengers… and maybe even zombie Thanos. Wonder Man : December Image: Marvel Studios Marvel is giving its Avenger-turned-Hollywood stuntman Simon Williams his own TV series for Disney Plus, and according to Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige , Wonder Man will be “extremely different from anything we’ve done before.” Yahya Abdul-Mateen II ( Aquaman , Watchmen ) will play Williams (aka Wonder Man) in the 10-episode series. Ben Kingsley will be back as Trevor Slattery, his character from Iron Man 3 and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings . They’ll be joined by Ed Harris, Lauren Glazier, and Demetrius Grosse. 2026 Spider-Man: Brand New Day: July 31 Image: Sony Pictures/Marvel Sony and Marvel Studios’ follow-up to 2021’s Spider-Man: No Way Home will bring star Tom Holland back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a new type of adventure. When we last saw Holland’s Peter Parker, all memories of Spider-Man’s secret identity had been wiped from the public consciousness. Brand New Day will give Spider-Man “a fresh start,” according to Holland. The fourth MCU Spider-Man movie is being helmed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton. Stranger Things and The Whale star Sadie Sink is reportedly part of the cast. The idea for Spider-Man 4 “is crazy,” Holland teased in an appearance on Good Morning America in 2024. “It's a little different to anything we've done before, but I think the fans are gonna really respond to it.” Based on its release date, Brand New Day was seemingly", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/21452835/new-marvel-movies-come-out-release-schedule/", "domain": "polygon.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 7, "title": "Avengers : Doomsday Fan Art Brings In Fan Favorite Characters Who...", "snippet": "Without a doubt, the most highly anticipated upcoming Marvel movie is Avengers : Doomsday , which will feature a giant ensemble cast.All will be revealed when Avengers : Doomsday hits theaters on December 18th of next year as art of the 2026 movie release list .", "full_content": "CinemaBlend and Yahoo may earn commission from links in this article.

Some epic fan art imagined even more heroes joining the blockbuster, and I really hope some of them actually end up appearing courtesy of The Russo Brothers. What we know about Avengers: Doomsday is limited, but fans are hyped about seeing entire teams of superheroes collide during its runtime. The Doomsday cast announcement confirmed a ton of actors, but a number of fan favorites were noticeably missing. Now, some fan art from Instagram has given them their own chairs, and it's pretty awesome to see. Check it out below: Moviegoers who spent years watching the Marvel movies in order know that certain characters have become fan favorites. Many of which are in this image, meaning they haven't been officially announced to have a role in Doomsday . Chief among them are Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, Tom Holland's Spider-Man, and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk. It's wild to imagine that the blockbuster won't feature any of the faces in the above image, but perhaps a few will be able to join the fray. Advertisement Advertisement Kevin Feige confirmed the announcement didn't feature every single member of the Doomsday cast, so there is still real hope that we'll see some of the other rumored heroes. Hopefully, we get some more information about the next Avengers movie sooner rather than later. Disney+: from $9.99 a month w/ ad-supported plan Disney+ is the streaming home for the MCU.

Mark Ruffalo also joked about not having his own chair , claiming the studio doesn't trust him with spoilers and left him out. But given how often Marvel stars are asked to lie to prevent spoilers, there's not a ton of trust between the actors and their fans. Some other faces in this fan art include Chris Evans, who was rumored to be playing a variant of Captain America in Doomsday . There are also some more OG actors from the X-Men movies in Halle Berry's Storm and Famke Janssen's Jean Grey. Rather than wearing their black leather costumes from the Fox movies, they're shown wearing bright, comic-accurate costumes. We also see Punisher, Deadpool, and even Moon Knight included in this fan art. And with Doomday being a multiversal story, it feels like just about anything could happen. All will be revealed when Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters on December 18th of next year as art of the 2026 movie release list . We'll just have to wait and see how many more Marvel stars get to join the already massive cast.

The Fantastic Four: First Stepsis on the lower end of that scale, premiering on Disney+ 103 days after its theatrical run. This gives it the shortest release window between an MCU's theatrical and streaming release in the past two years. Nevertheless, fans who did not manage to catch the movie in cinemas will soon be able to enjoy the Earth-828 flick from the comfort of their home.

Credit: Marvel Studios The Avengers have been the heroic core of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Robert Downey Jr burst into the world as Tony Stark in Iron Man (2008). Since then, the MCU has worked in Kevin Feige’s beloved Phases to bring the central group of Iron Man, Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) together, drive them apart, and then bring them back in a very big way with Avengers: Endgame (2019).

Credit: Disney+ While Marvel has not released any further details of the special, it is definitely part of the ongoing LEGO Marvel collaborations that began in 2013.

Whether that means that the new LEGO movie will have a darker tone than the mostly comedic, child-friendly shorts will remain to be seen, but it’ll still be nice to have some Avengers action earlier than expected. Credit: Disney Marvel Avengers Upcoming Projects In July 2022, Kevin Feige announced that the current Multiverse Saga of the Marvel Cinematic Universe would culminate in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars , respectively, scheduled for 2026 and 2027. There is much reason to believe that Marvel Studios will struggle to meet those dates, however. For one thing, the Disney-owned company has repeatedly rescheduled numerous movies and shows in the last few years. For another, the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes have ground the development and production of basically every movie in Hollywood to a halt.

The actor’s well-publicized legal issues have raised doubt about whether the studio will need to recast the character in a hurry and give the heroes someone else to fight against. We’ll just have to wait for October 27 to see who the Avengers face off against this time. Will the Avengers face Kang in Code Red or some other threat?

In an interview with La Resolana , Tenoch Huerta revealed that each character will have “ smaller roles ” in Avengers: Doomsday .

It’s more condensed since they have to make room for all the characters and the different universes that appear.” Also, in an interview, Huerta talked about meeting Robert Downey Jr. on the set of Avengers: Doomsday . “He’s really handsome, dude. The guy looks really young too. What happened was that I wasn’t in the scene — I went to see the directors because I wanted to talk to them about some lines and meet them face to face. When I was there, he came over to check the monitors, and I said, ‘Ah, no way!’ I actually said, ‘Damn, I left my kneepads back at the hotel, man!’” There are rumors that the first trailer for Avengers: Doomsday is expected to be released in theaters alongside Avatar: Fire and Ash on December 18, 2025.

I think one of the things I admire most about the film, and that I was so pleasantly surprised by when I read the script, is that it had the perfect balance of comedy and heart. It wasn’t a movie that was completely making fun of itself the whole time, but it has a good sense of humor. I’m really, really proud of what we did. It’s so hard to walk away from these movies because so much is going to be done in post that you’re like, “How do I assess what we just walked away from?” But I just have a feeling about this one.

View Urgent Forecast Rumors suggest the first trailer for Avengers: Doomsday will play before the release of Avatar: Fire and Ash on December 19, 2025. Although Marvel Studios hasn’t officially confirmed this, new information has surfaced detailing what fans might see in the Doomsday trailer. What does the Avengers: Doomsday teaser trailer reportedly show? Film Threat’s Chris Gore says the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday trailer will feature a lot of exciting footage of Doctor Doom in action, though he can’t reveal specific details. Gore explained that viewers will get a full look at Doctor Doom, not just a brief one. He described the character, as envisioned by Downey, as a classic Universal monster – similar to Lon Chaney’s Phantom of the Opera – a tragic and broken figure. Unlike Iron Man, who used his armor as a superpower, Doom needs the armor to function because he’s physically scarred and broken. Someone else described it this way, and Gore agreed with the interpretation. Beyond his scientific skills, Doom also wields magic, adding another layer to his power. Right now, this is just speculation, and shouldn’t be taken as fact. Official details about the plot of Avengers: Doomsday haven’t been released yet. The next Avengers movie, Doomsday , is scheduled to come out in US cinemas on December 18, 2026, as part of the sixth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Smith Show . “That’s the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft. Focus on being the best version of you.” Though they aren’t married, Travis did spill some details about what they do on date night. “We mentioned Pretty Woman ,” the Kansas City Chiefs player said in a recent episode of his New Heights podcast, “That’s been on me and Tay’s movie list for a while, I’d be down to watch that.” However, the rumors being dispelled doesn’t mean that marriage isn’t on their mind. An insider source said to Life & Style Magazine back in April 2024, “Travis is eager to speed up their relationship timeline.

Swifties are adamant their icon has tied the knot with her NFL boyfriend Travis Kelce . ‌ An image shared online showed the duo, both 35, were invited to the wedding of Chicago Bears player Cole Kmet, who exchanged vows with Emily Jarosz on Saturday. The snap, uploaded by the Kmet's event planner, Ellie Nottoli, showed the pop icon and Kansas City Chiefs tight end's elegant invitation. ‌ And it was the way it was addressed that sent eagle-eyed fans wild. In the note, which showcased beautiful calligraphy, \"Taylor and Travis Kelce\" were assigned to Table 13. Fans were quick to note it is Taylor's favourite number, while also spotting there was no sign of \"Swift\". ‌ View 3 Images The note had Taylor's fans going wild (Image: Instagram) In the upload, Nottoli said: \"We all know Taylor and Travis were at a different wedding in Tennessee. But each guest had an envelope that was adhered to a beautiful backdrop, and Emily wrote love notes to all of her guests.\" Fans quickly reacted, calling it a clear indication the pair had secretly married. \"TAYLOR AND TRAVIS KELCE?!????? EXCUSE ME,\" one stunned fan gasped. \"'I KNEW IT!!,\" exclaimed another. ‌ A third added: \"This feels like something we shouldn’t be seeing,\" hinting that any ceremony wasn't supposed to be public knowledge. And a fourth simply asked: \"'They got married ?\" But not everyone was on board with the theory. One user explained they thought the lack of Taylor's second name was simply for the \"aesthetic\". Another added that if they were married: \"'Technically it should be Travis and Taylor Kelce.\" The duo first went public with their relationship in 2023. Since then, they have been very supportive partners and are regularly seen attending games and concerts when their busy schedules allow. ‌ They also stunned the world with a sweet Super Bowl kiss, while Travis also joined his partner on stage during her Eras Tour. Before they became an official item, Travis told his podcast \"New Heights,\" that he tried to give Swift his number via a friendship bracelet during a concert, but was disappointed to learn that she doesn't talk before or after shows to save her voice. View 3 Images Taylor and Travis have been an item since 2023 (Image: Getty Images) However, he was given another chance to shoot his shot, leaving Swift impressed by his efforts. Fans were sent wild in November of the same year as Taylor changed the lyrics in \"Karma\" at a concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina. ‌ She switched from \"Karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me\" to \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.\" The star was later spotted running to her man to give him a kiss. The shows of affection continued to get more in the public eye in the following months and in 2024 a selfie of Taylor, Travis, Prince William and his two eldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, was posted from her London concert, which also counted as the NFL star's first Instagram-official shot on her feed. The duo have continued to go from strength to strength and the latest speculation would be widely celebrated by Swifties across the globe. Article continues below Like this story?

The Grammy award-winning musician, 32, and actor, 31, apparently got engaged some months ago but chose to keep it quiet , with Taylor only wearing her ring ‘behind closed doors.’ Speculation was rife in January of this year that the couple had got engaged while on a whirlwind trip to Cornwall, which they have previously described as a place very special to them. However neither commented on the rumours. Now a source has claimed to The Sun that the Seven singer and Conversations With Friends actor are engaged but have no plans to publicly announce it and have only confided in their ‘inner inner circle.’ They have told only ‘immediate family and trusted, very old friends,’ the source said, adding that ‘everyone has been sworn to secrecy’ and some of Taylor’s team do not even know about the engagement. Engagement rumours swirled in January but neither Joe nor Taylor commented at the time (Picture: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank The source went on to say that only a ‘handful’ of people know about the wedding plans, but the couple are ‘very, very in love,’ and Taylor wears her ‘beautiful ring’ when she’s at home. ‘They want their love to stay away from the cameras as much as possible,’ they said. ‘This is just for them. ‘And if and when they do exchange vows, there most definitely won’t be any Vogue, Rolling Stone or Hello! magazines there. It will be simple and elegant — like them.’ The couple are very private and have made only a handful of red carpet appearances together (Picture: REX/Shutterstock) Taylor, who recently dropped a new song for the soundtrack of Where The Crawdads Sing, and Joe have been together for six years, first meeting in 2016. The couple are intensely private, making only a handful of red carpet appearances together and very rarely speaking about each other in interviews. In fact, the closest either got to responding to engagement rumours was Joe suggesting in April that ‘if the answer was yes, I wouldn’t say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn’t say.’ Explaining their decision to be private to British Vogue in 2018, Style singer Taylor said: ‘I’m aware people want to know about that side of things. I think we have been successfully very private, and that has now sunk in for people… but I really prefer to talk about work.’ Joe and Taylor have been together for six years, first meeting in 2016 (Picture: GC Images) Before meeting Joe, Taylor was involved in several high-profile relationships leading back to when she was a teenager, including with Taylor Lautner, Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhall and John Mayer. Her last relationship before Joe was with Loki actor Tom Hiddleston; he too has now chosen to remain private about his relationships since the intense scrutiny placed on them by the public and media. The Marvel star became engaged to actress Zawe Ashton in March of this year, but waited several months before confirming the news publicly.

The two reportedly got engaged a few months ago after the Conversations With Friends actor got down on one knee, with only their closest circle friends being privy to their plans to marry. ‌ The couple have been together since 2016 and are planning a lowkey and elegant ceremony, writes the Mirror. Before Joe, she dated Hollywood star Tom Hiddleston in a whirlwind romance after her 16-month relationship with Scots chart-topper Calvin Harris before their bitter break-up. Before Calvin, 38, and Tom, 41, the Bad Blood singer dated fellow pop sensation Harry Styles as he allegedly inspired her hit I Knew You Were Trouble. ‌ A source close to Joe told The Sun : \"Taylor and Joe are incredibly happy, and very, very in love, they’ve actually been engaged for a few months but have only told their inner-inner circle - basically immediate family, and trusted, very old friends. Everyone has been sworn to secrecy, too. Taylor has a beautiful ring but she only wears it when she’s at home - i.e behind closed doors. ‌ \"Again, only a handful of people know details about the wedding and Taylor hasn’t even told some of her team about the engagement.\" READ MORE: Paolo Nutini releases new album Last Night In The Bittersweet as fans are go wild READ MORE: Louise Thompson hospitalised after 'alarming' test results as partner Ryan says he's 'holding on by thread' ‌ The publication reports there isn't any specific wedding details yet and it is unknown if Taylor and Joe will officially announced their engagement. The pair previously sparked rumours of an engagement back in January as they jet-setted 4,000 miles from Nashville to St Ives for a romantic break. The rumour mill was in full flow thanks to their trip to the picturesque fishing harbour town in Cornwall which is said to be \"particularly special\" to them. Pop sensation Taylor and Joe have been together for six years and split their time between the US and London. A source familiar with the couple said the pair's relationship intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic as it resulted in them living together throughout the lockdowns. London-born Alwyn gained recognition after starring in war drama Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk in 2016. ‌ View 2 Images Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn are said to be engaged (Image: Getty) READ MORE : Who is Arielle Free?

I don’t know how best to talk about it. I mean, I’m aware of people’s… of that size of interest, and that world existing. \"It’s just not something I particularly care about, or have much interest in feeding, I guess, because the more it’s fed, the more you are opening a gate for intrusion. I think that’s just my response to a culture that has this increasing expectation that everything is going to be given.\" ‌ In 2019, Joe revealed that he liked when Taylor wrote songs about him. When asked by The Sunday Times if he minded being her subject matter for her music, he said: “No, not at all. No. It’s flattering,\" The actor even co-wrote songs with Swift for her most recent albums, Folklore and Evermore, which were released last year. He wrote under the pseudonym William Bowery. Swift has avoided talking about Alwyn in interviews, and speaking to The Guardian about her decision, she said: “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.\" When Taylor's Miss Americana documentary was released on Netflix, Taylor gave an insight into how her and Joe's relationship started in 2016, after her bitter Snapchat fallout with Kim Kardashian. “I felt alone, I felt really bitter,” she said. “I felt sort of like a wounded animal lashing out. I figured I had to reset everything. I had to reconstruct an entire belief system for my own personal sanity. I also was falling in love with someone who had a wonderfully normal, balanced life.” ‌ In 2020 she hinted that Joe helped inspired her song Peace, while talking to Paul McCartney for Rolling Stone. She explained the song “is actually more rooted in my personal life.

It’s the aesthetic.” Another shared the same sentiment, “I’m engaged, but even when we were dating, invited would be addressed to ‘<fiancés name> and <fiancé’s last name>’. It’s not that weird. It’s solely for aesthetic purposes.” Swift and Kelce skipped Kmet and Jarosz’s wedding, but they did step out for another nuptials on Friday, June 6, per People.

The source of the rumors is a photograph of the singer that has surfaced online. Swift and Alwyn haven’t announced that they are engaged, but there have been rumors that they are. A picture of the singer that has been posted on TMZ shows her wearing a diamond ring on her finger, which many people saw as an indication that she may have tied the knot in secret, just like Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin did last year. This rumor has been debunked because while the fans noticed the diamond ring on Swift’s finger they failed to notice that it was on her right hand. It is possible that the singer may be changing the rules by wearing an engagement ring on the right hand, but this seems very unlikely. Although Swift and Alwyn may not be engaged, their relationship has never been stronger. The two celebrities have been dating since 2017, and when they were spotted at the “SNL” cast after party at Zuma in New York City. On their way to the party, Swift and Alwyn walked into the venue by holding each other’s hands. They reportedly packed on some PDA at the party too. Swift and Alwyn are rarely seen in public, so their recent outing is significant. The singer wore a black blazer and sparkling pants for the after party, People reported. Her boyfriend on the other hand wore gray shirt and blue jeans. He finished the look with a black coat. Swift was at the party because she performed “False God” for the first time on “SNL” as a guest. She also performed an acoustic version of the title track from her album “Lover” that was released in August.

This decision comes as the streaming giant continues to dominate the market, boasting an impressive 301.6 million subscribers worldwide. Let’s dive into the details of this latest Netflix price increase and explore its potential implications for viewers and the company alike. Netflix’s soaring success and the rationale behind the price increase Netflix’s journey from a DVD rental service to a global streaming powerhouse has been nothing short of remarkable. The platform’s success can be attributed to its captivating original content and user-friendly interface. Hit series like “Squid Game,” “Wednesday,” and “Stranger Things” have played a crucial role in attracting and retaining subscribers. The company’s fourth quarter of 2024 saw an influx of nearly 19 million new users, pushing its total subscriber base past the 300 million mark. This surge in popularity has translated into impressive financial results, with quarterly revenue reaching $10.2 billion and net profit approaching $2 billion. Netflix A famous director scams Netflix out of $11 million for a series he never finished, and now faces prison time. Despite these stellar figures, Netflix has decided to implement a price increase. The company’s spokesperson, MoMo Zho, explained the rationale behind this decision to The Verge : “As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value to our members, we’ll occasionally ask our subscribers to pay a bit more so that we can reinvest to further improve Netflix.” This statement suggests that the price hike is aimed at funding future content development and enhancing the overall streaming experience. While some viewers may balk at the increased costs, Netflix seems confident that the added value will justify the higher prices. Breaking down the new pricing structure The updated Netflix subscription costs will affect users in four countries: the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Portugal. Here’s a breakdown of the new pricing structure for U.S. subscribers: Subscription Plan Old Price New Price Increase Standard with ads $6.99/month $7.99/month $1.00 Standard without ads $15.49/month $17.99/month $2.50 Premium $22.99/month $24.99/month $2.00 As we can see, the most significant increase is in the standard ad-free plan, which has gone up by $2.50 per month. This price adjustment strategy seems to push users towards either the ad-supported tier or the premium option, potentially maximizing revenue while offering viewers a choice based on their preferences and budget. Potential impact on subscribers and the streaming landscape While the price increase may be unwelcome news for many Netflix subscribers, it’s essential to consider the broader context of the streaming industry. As competition intensifies, with services like Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video vying for viewers’ attention, Netflix’s decision to raise prices could have several implications: Content quality and quantity : The additional revenue could lead to more high-budget productions and exclusive content, potentially justifying the higher costs for subscribers. Subscriber retention : Some users may reconsider their subscription or downgrade to a lower-tier plan, potentially impacting Netflix’s growth rate. Industry-wide ripple effect : Other streaming services might follow suit, leading to a general increase in subscription costs across the board. Ad-supported tier growth : The widening gap between ad-supported and ad-free plans could drive more users to opt for the cheaper, ad-inclusive option. It’s worth noting that while these price changes currently affect only four countries, they could be a harbinger of global price adjustments in the future. Subscribers in other regions, including France, should be prepared for potential increases down the line. Netflix This Netflix movie becomes No. 1 in 79 countries just one day after its release, viewers love it! This situation bears some similarities to other industries where pricing strategies can significantly impact consumer behavior. For instance, in the metals market, factors such as supply, demand, and production costs can cause fluctuations in prices. The tungsten carbide value and its market rates are influenced by various factors, much like how Netflix’s pricing is affected by content production costs and market dynamics. Navigating the changing streaming landscape As Netflix implements these price changes, subscribers may need to reassess their streaming habits and budgets.

The call revealed that the company experienced record growth in the previous quarter, attributed to popular offerings like “Squid Game: Season 2,” live NFL football, and the Tyson vs. Paul fight. Consequently, the streaming giant will be raising the cost of all subscription tiers. Starting with the standard monthly membership without advertisements, the price will increase from $15.49 to $17.99. Interestingly, Netflix is also increasing the price of the ad-supported plan; the standard account with ads will rise by one dollar, from $6.99 to $7.99 per month. For those seeking premium features, the highest-priced tier, which includes 4K video quality, will see a $2 increase, raising the monthly cost from $22.99 to $24.99. These price adjustments come after Netflix reported a substantial increase in subscribers during the fourth quarter of 2024.

New subscribers will see the new prices right away. Current subscribers will notice the new prices in the coming weeks. Why is Netflix Raising Prices? Netflix says these price increases help them make more and better shows and movies. They spend a lot of money on original content. This includes popular shows like “Stranger Things” and movies like “The Irishman.” They also face competition from other streaming services like Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu. These services also make their own content. The need to stay competitive and provide quality entertainment is a big reason for the price hikes. How Netflix’s Prices Compare It’s helpful to see how Netflix’s prices stack up against its competitors. Here’s a quick comparison: Streaming Service Basic Plan (if applicable) Standard Plan Premium Plan (if applicable) Netflix $7.99 (with ads) $17.99 $24.99 Disney+ $7.99 (with ads) $13.99 (no ads) N/A Hulu $7.99 (with ads) $14.99 (no ads) N/A Amazon Prime Video Included with Amazon Prime ($14.99/month or $139/year) Included with Amazon Prime N/A As you can see, Netflix’s standard and premium plans are now among the most expensive. However, they also offer a wide selection of content. What Can Subscribers Do? If you’re a Netflix subscriber, you have a few options: Keep your current plan and pay the new price. Switch to a cheaper plan, like the ad-supported option. Consider sharing an account with family or friends (though Netflix is cracking down on this). Cancel your subscription and switch to a different streaming service. The Future of Streaming Prices It’s likely that streaming prices will keep changing. Companies will keep trying to find the right balance between making money and keeping subscribers happy. The competition in the streaming market will also play a big part in how companies price their products. We may see more bundling of services or different types of plans in the future. Understanding Bundled Streaming Services Many people use more than one streaming service. This can get expensive. Some companies offer bundles. These bundles combine different services at a lower price than if you bought them separately. For example, Disney offers a bundle that includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. These bundles can be a good way to save money if you want to watch content from different providers. Look into bundles if you want to save money on streaming.

The cost of the standard ad-supported tier in the U.S. will rise to $7.99 per month, up from $6.99 . Meanwhile, the premium tier will see an increase of $2 , bringing it to $24.99 . Additionally, the standard plan will now cost $17.99 , up from $15.49 . The fee for adding an extra member to an ad-free plan will also increase to $8.99 , up from $7.99 . These price adjustments will affect most plans in the U.S., Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. New customers will see these changes starting Tuesday, while existing customers will experience the adjustments in their next billing cycle. This marks the first price hike for the ad-supported tier. The last significant increase in the U.S. occurred in October 2023, when Netflix raised the standard plan from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and increased the premium price from $19.99 to $22.99 . Furthermore, Netflix is expanding its Extra Member with Ads plan in 10 out of the 12 countries where it offers an ad-supported option, maintaining the price at $6.99 . Netflix attributes these price hikes to its growing investment in programming. “As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members, we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further enhance Netflix,” stated the company in its shareholder letter. Currently, Netflix spends approximately $17 billion annually on content. Executives have indicated that they expect this figure to remain relatively stable. However, the company is also investing in more live sporting events, including high-profile matchups like Mike Tyson vs. Logan Paul, NFL Christmas Day games, and WWE’s weekly show, Raw. During the earnings call, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos highlighted the upcoming content lineup, which includes new seasons of popular shows like Wednesday , Stranger Things , and Squid Game , along with films from renowned directors such as Guillermo del Toro, Catherine Bigelow, Noah Baumbach, and the Russo brothers, plus a new installment of Knives Out . Netflix is also set to host the SAG Awards next month. “When you’re going to ask for a price increase, you better ensure you have the goods and the engagement to back it up. I feel confident about what we have lined up for 2025,” Sarandos remarked. This announcement comes on the heels of Netflix reporting a record-breaking addition of 19 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, bringing its total to 302 million subscribers . The company reported $10.2 billion in revenue and an operating income of $2.3 billion . Co-CEO Greg Peters emphasized that the company’s pricing philosophy remains unchanged, asserting that the pricing for the standard ad-supported plans provides a “highly accessible entry point.” “We aim to continually offer more value to our members by investing wisely to enhance the variety and quality of our entertainment offerings. We also pay close attention to member feedback, including engagement, retention, and acquisition metrics, to gauge when we’ve successfully increased value. When we achieve that, we ask them to contribute a bit more to sustain that virtuous cycle,” Peters explained.

The latest price increment makes it the second price adjustment by the platform within the space of 3 months, having implemented a price increment earlier in April this year. According to the price update on the company’s website, the Standard plan subscription, which is popular among Nigerian subscribers for its HD quality and multi-screen viewing options, has been increased from N4,000 to N5,500. This represents a 37.5% increment.

April increment Earlier in April, the streaming giant announced an increment that saw its Premium Plan price moved to N5,000 from N4,400. At the same time, the Standard Plan was increased from N3,600 to N4,000, while the Basic Plan remained unchanged at N2,900. At the time, Netflix said the price adjustment was part of a broader strategy to revise its subscription fees across various regions. The changes, according to the company, were aimed at accelerating its revenue and earnings growth, following a pattern of periodic price hikes to support the expansion of content offerings. What you should know The Netflix price increment comes amid high inflation in Nigeria that has pushed up prices of every product and service being offered in the country. While Nigerians grapple with skyrocketing food prices, home entertainment is becoming out of reach for many households as a result of price increases. Major Pay-TV operator in the country, Multichoice, also recently implemented its third price increment in the space of one year, sparking negative reactions from many Nigerians. Meanwhile, Netflix has been adjusting prices in key markets globally, including the United States, United Kingdom, and France, with the Basic and Premium plans experiencing increases in October 2023. As streaming services continue to evolve, Netflix’s pricing strategy appears to be a balancing act between maintaining a competitive edge and investing in content that keeps viewers engaged. With the Nigerian entertainment market growing rapidly, the updated pricing is expected to contribute to Netflix’s ongoing efforts to solidify its presence in the region. Furthermore, after years of maintaining an ad-free platform, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos confirmed that the company would begin testing an ad-supported, lower-priced subscription tier. This decision was influenced by a challenging year for Netflix, which included subscriber losses and increased competition from other streaming services. The new ad-supported plan, known as “Basic with Ads,” was launched in various countries, offering a more affordable option for subscribers willing to watch commercials.

You can do it with the WebBrowser component from .NET as gregswiss pointed out, but you can also do it with : Python: Scrapy (The most popular web scraper, Also you'll find lot of tutorials) Javascript: Casper JS (wich relies on Phantom JS a headless web browser) Java: Jaunt (it is my favorite, comes with relevant examples), or write your own web scraper using org.apache.commons.httpclient. PHP:http://www.programminghelp.com/php/basic-web-scraping-regex-php/http://www.jacobward.co.uk/web-scraping-with-php-curl-part-1/ You can find more example here :http://jaunt-api.com/jaunt-tutorial.htm There exist a number of approaches that you can use to get Netflix working. You can make you own API which is not that hard. If you intend to have it for your own purposes that will be overkill, but if you intend to have at least some users it is feasible. The main thing you need to remember is that usually a first call is required (to save/get cookie). After that you can login and later display the content to the user or create you own design from the fetched data. Your relevant options: I use a combination of the first and second option in a project of mine. However, my project is not related to anything close to yours except for that it use cookies, login and API. Good luck! If you are using .NET, maybe a simpler approach would be to use aWebBrowsercontrol. Simply point it tohttp://www.netflix.com. You can then set username/password and simulate a click to the submit button and extract data from your pages using DOM. You won't have to worry about extracting and managing cookie etc. as it's essentially taken care of. Inspect the requests in the network tab, replicate them usingpostmanor something similar to see if they work from anywhere or if you need to have asession cookie, then write a script in your chosen language to handle the posts that you will use.

Its what I found: Now you can use full player API. For exampleplayer.seekorplayer.getCurrentTimeorplayer.pause, etc...

Current time and pause status: can be easily obtained using (Simply accessing this data doesn't redirect to the error page) this pauses/unpaused the video. You can use paused status fetching described above to make sure that you don't unpause video that's already paused. Add script, which itself adds elements to the document with click event listeners: Seek: This has the same solution as above: add an element with an event listener, which uses spotify API to seek. Special thing here is that we need to pass a timestamp. This can be done by setting an attribute value to our element: Now all we need to do is trigger this event after setting the timestamp: In this exemple the player will play the video at 10000ms.

The media players built by these services make use of EME to invoke the underlying DRM (Digital Rights Management) And yes, of course you can build your own solution using EME. To add to the other answers and comments - the screen capture prevention mechanisms are actually dependent on the DRM security level and the device capabilities and so may be different on different machines. Browsers using a SW based DRM solution which is not linked in to the secure media path on the device actually will allow screen capture. Browsers using a HW based DRM or a SW one which is linked to the device secure media path will prevent screen capture. Typically streaming services restrict their high resolution content, e.g. 4K, and sometimes even their high value content, e.g. live sports, to devices which support a secure media path. You can see this with popular streaming services where you may be able to stream a video in 4K on one browser/device combination but only in 720p on another, even on the same device. Content security is an ever changing domain so you may find a particular browser and device combination supports different security levels over time. in macOS, you can screenshot in Netflix —> Chrome > Settings > System > Disable Hardware Acceleration.

The changes, effective immediately, reflect the streaming giant’s continued investment in exclusive programming and live content expansion. The ad-supported tier, introduced at approx. $7 USD per month in 2022, will now cost approx. $8 USD. The standard ad-free tier sees a notable increase, rising approx. $3 USD to around $18 USD per month, while the premium plan jumps $2 USD, reaching around $25 USD. The announcement comes amid unprecedented growth for Netflix, which reported its largest quarterly subscriber gain ever. The platform added 18.9 million new users in the final quarter of 2024, doubling analyst expectations and reaching a milestone of 300 million global subscribers. This growth surge stems largely from Netflix’s expansion into live content. Recent successes include the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match and the platform’s inaugural NFL Christmas game broadcasts, both achieving record viewership. Original content continues to perform strongly on the platform as well, with Squid Game season two attracting 68 million viewers in its first week of release. Netflix has also introduced new subscription options, including an “Extra Member With Ads” feature that allows ad-supported subscribers to add external users for approx. $8 USD monthly, comparable to the near $9 USD fee for ad-free subscribers’ additional users.

Marvel was founded in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics , [ 3 ] and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics . The Marvel era began in August 1961 with the launch of The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee , Jack Kirby , Steve Ditko , and numerous others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years and decades, was solidified as the company's primary brand. Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man , Wolverine , Iron Man , Captain America , Hulk , Thor , Doctor Strange , Daredevil , Black Panther , and Captain Marvel , as well as popular superhero teams such as the Avengers , X-Men , Fantastic Four , and Guardians of the Galaxy . Its stable of well-known supervillains includes Doctor Doom , Magneto , Green Goblin , Venom , Red Skull , Loki , Ultron , Thanos , Apocalypse , and Galactus . Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe , with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City. [ 4 ] Additionally, Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics , twice from 1977 to 1987 , and again since 2015 . History Timely Publications Main article: Timely Comics Marvel Comics #1 (Oct. 1939), the first comic from Marvel precursor Timely Comics . Cover art by Frank R. Paul . Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Goodman, who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into the emerging—and by then already highly popular—new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of editor , managing editor , and business manager , with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother) [ 7 ] officially listed as publisher. [ 6 ] Timely's first publication, Marvel Comics #1 ( cover dated Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl Burgos ' android superhero the Human Torch , and the first appearances of Bill Everett 's anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner , [ 8 ] among other features. [ 5 ] The issue was a great success; it and a second printing the following month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies. [ 9 ] While its contents came from an outside packager, Funnies, Inc. , [ 5 ] Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company's first true editor, writer-artist Joe Simon , teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes, [ 10 ] Captain America , in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one million. [ 9 ] Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941. [ 3 ] [ 11 ] While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters, some notable heroes—many of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer , Miss America , the Destroyer , the original Vision , and the Angel .

Iron Man Experience Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle! Official website https://www.marvel.com/ The Marvel Universe is a fictional shared universe where the stories in most American comic book titles and other media published by Marvel Comics take place. Superhero teams such as the Avengers , the X-Men , the Fantastic Four , the Guardians of the Galaxy , and many Marvel superheroes live in this universe, including characters such as Spider-Man , Wolverine , Iron Man , Captain America , and Hulk . It also contains well-known supervillains such as Doctor Doom , Magneto , Green Goblin , Loki , and Thanos . It also contains antiheroes such as Deadpool , Ghost Rider , Punisher , Elektra , and Black Cat . The Marvel Universe is further depicted as existing within a \" multiverse \" consisting of thousands of separate universes, all of which are the creations of Marvel Comics and all of which are, in a sense, \"Marvel universes\". In this context, \"Marvel Universe\" is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel continuity , which is known as Earth-616 or Prime Earth . History Some of the characters in Timely Comics (the 1930s and '40s predecessor to Marvel Comics) coexisted in the same world, as first established in Marvel Mystery Comics #7 (1940) where Namor was mentioned in Human Torch 's story, and vice versa. Later several superheroes (who starred in separate stories in the series up to that point) met each other in a group dubbed the All-Winners Squad . Though the concept of a shared universe was not new or unique to comic books in 1961, writer/editor Stan Lee , together with several artists including Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko , created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters' growth and change. [ 1 ] Headline characters in one title would make cameos or guest appearances in other books. Fantastic Four #12 is the first crossover comic book in modern Marvel continuity (first meeting of Fantastic Four and the Hulk). Eventually, many of the leading heroes (Ant-Man, Wasp, Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk) assembled into a team known as the Avengers , which debuted in September 1963. This was not the first time that Marvel's characters had interacted with one another— Namor and the original Human Torch had been rivals when Marvel was Timely Comics (Marvel Vault), under editor Martin Goodman [ 2 ] — but it was the first time that the comic book publisher's characters seemed to share a world. [ 3 ] The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in New York City ; by contrast, many DC heroes live in fictional cities. Care was taken to portray the city and the world as realistically as possible, with the presence of superhumans affecting the common citizens in various ways.

Avengers: Doomsday plot – what will Avengers 5 be about? Avengers: Doomsday trailer – any Avengers 5 footage yet? Avengers: Doomsday might have been delayed until December 2026 , but we have now at least had our first look at Doctor Doom in the MCU . The mid-credit scene of The Fantastic Four: First Steps marks Doctor Doom's MCU debut, although we only see him from behind. Avengers: Doomsday started filming in late April after its unique cast announcement that featured a lot of chairs, including some exciting X-Men additions and major omissions . During Marvel's Comic-Con panel in July 2024, it was confirmed that Joe and Anthony Russo were back to direct Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars . What's more, Robert Downey Jr is back, but not as Iron Man... as Doctor Doom. The Russos are taking over from original director Destin Daniel Cretton, who left the movie in November 2023. Stephen McFeely has written the script, taking over from Jeff Loveness, but Michael Waldron is also helping on Doomsday 's script. The pair will also be writing Avengers: Secret Wars . The next Avengers movie is half of a double bill that will bring The Multiverse Saga to a close , but before we can even start thinking of Secret Wars , there's a lot that needs to be done with Avengers: Doomsday . Here's everything you need to know about Avengers : Doomsday . Alberto E. Rodriguez // Getty Images Sign up to Disney+ Avengers: Doomsday release date – when can we expect Avengers 5? As mentioned above, Avengers: Doomsday has been hit by another release date delay and will now land in cinemas on 18 December 2026 . That's a seven-month delay from the previous release date of 1 May 2026, which itself was a year delay from the original 2 May 2025 release . The delay has also impacted Avengers: Secret Wars which will now land in cinemas on 17 December 2027 instead of 7 May 2027. Filming has at least now started on Avengers: Doomsday and like the Infinity War / Endgame double-bill, filming is planned to start on Avengers: Secret Wars pretty soon after Doomsday wraps. \"We're shooting them fairly back-to-back, it's a lot of work again, we may or may not survive, we'll see,\" Joe Russo confirmed in March 2025 . Marvel Studios Avengers: Doomsday cast – who is joining Robert Downey Jr in Avengers 5? Let's start with the massive news. Robert Downey Jr has been confirmed to play iconic Marvel villain Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday . We don't know exactly how it'll work yet, but it wouldn't be a surprise if this Doctor Doom comes from whatever world the upcoming Fantastic Four movie takes place in. It remains to be seen if Victor Von Doom is a Tony Stark variant. Jesse Grant // Getty Images We had to wait until March 2025 for further official cast additions, but we now know thanks to a bunch of chairs that the following MCU stars are coming back for Avengers: Doomsday : • Chris Hemsworth (Thor) • Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman) • Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America) • Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes) • Letitia Wright (Shuri/Black Panther) • Paul Rudd (Scott Lang/Ant-Man) • Wyatt Russell (John Walker/US Agent) • Tenoch Huerta Mejía (Namor) • Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) • Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) • Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova) Marvel Studios • Kelsey Grammer (Hank McCoy/Beast) • Lewis Pullman (Robert 'Bob' Reynolds/Sentry) • Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres/Falcon) • Joseph Quinn (Johnny Storm/Human Torch) • David Harbour (Red Guardian) • Winston Duke (M'Baku) • Hannah John-Kamen (Ava Starr/Ghost) • Tom Hiddleston (Loki) • Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier/Professor X) • Ian McKellen (Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto) • Alan Cumming (Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler) • Rebecca Romijn (Raven Darkhölme/Mystique) • James Marden (Scott Summers/Cyclops) • Channing Tatum (Remy LeBeau/Gambit) • Pedro Pascal (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic) The presence of the Thunderbolts* and The Fantastic Four casts aren't a surprise, given Feige confirmed they'd be in the Avengers movies at Comic-Con 2024 , but the OG X-Men returns are the ones to get fans most excited. We're still missing some major names that were widely expected to be in Avengers: Doomsday , such as Tom Holland's Spider-Man . However, Downey Jr teased future cast announcements to come in March 2025, but nobody else has been announced yet. Sony Pictures // Marvel Studios Who could those additional stars be? It's unclear at this point, but plenty of MCU stars have been having their say on potential returns.

We break down everything we know about every Marvel movie and TV show currently in the works. by Erik Amaya | May 22, 2025 | Comments TAGGED AS: Marvel , MCU , movies , streaming , TV [Updated August 1, 2025] The story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel Studios itself has been a tumultuous one since the release of Avengers: Endgame . The Phase Four films and television shows left audiences wondering if there was a new saga at all . The need to generate material for Disney+ also left many feeling the studio was unfocused and overextended, something studio president Kevin Feige would partially admit in 2025. Nevertheless, at SDCC 2022, he tried to quell some of these misgivings by revealing the full calendar for Phases Five and Six, labeling the whole thing as “The Multiverse Saga.” But almost as soon as the Multiverse calendar was made public, alterations were made. Movies shifted release dates and production schedules. Two industry strikes forced all television and movie production to grind to halt. Disney itself changed its priorities and instructed Marvel to slow its pipeline. The expected big bad of the new saga, Kang the Conqueror, proved unimpressive in his true debut appearance — Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — while the actor who portrayed him faced criminal charges in New York. He was ultimately let go from his Marvel contract, but it was unclear if Kang would carry on or be completely replaced with a difference character. And it just so happened that Doctor Doom seemed to be the logical replacement and Robert Downey Jr. was available… It all reveals that, despite the planning involved, Marvel Studios is malleable and ready to alter those plans if need be. Meanwhile, back in the MCU, heroes must rise, ne’er-do-wells must do what they do, and Marvel’s First Family must finally take its moment in the spotlight. And, as we have for the last few years, we’re keeping track of it all in this comprehensive guide of every upcoming Marvel Studios film (and television show) with a handy calendar of the studio’s projects through 2027 (and beyond). As always, we will continue to update this page frequently as new details emerge. And be careful: There are spoilers ahead. (Want to see what the other camp is up to? Check out our full breakdown of upcoming DC Studios movies .) WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT In Phase Six And beyond The SDCC 2024 presentation was full of bombast — from a Deadpool choir singing “Like A Prayer” to the Downey as Doom reveal — but was surprisingly short on words like “phase”, “Multiverse”, and “saga.” Consequently, it is unclear if that system of notation is still in place. What you can expect in lieu of phases is the end of the current saga in two upcoming Avengers films and the return of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in his fourth MCU outing. Also, there are a few TV shows readying for release that may still matter to the ongoing threads of Marvel storytelling… Although it remains unclear if phases remain part of the studio’s reported seven year calendar, we’re holding onto the nomenclature for all the projects set for release after First Steps until Feige offers an update on this aspect of the Marvel Method. Eyes of Wakanda (animated series) Premiere Date: August 6, 2025 What We Know: The anthology miniseries focuses on different protectors of Wakanda throughout its history. A clip shown at the 2024 D23 Marvel Animation presentation revealed a female Black Panther protecting her nation’s vibranium resources during the Age of Piracy, for example. Former Marvel storyboard artist Todd Harris serves as the series director and creator while Black Panther director Ryan Coogler serves as an executive producer. In July 2025, Disney released the first trailer for the series. How It Fits in the MCU: Unlike the other animated programs, Eyes of Wakanda details the history of Wakanda within the MCU. Of course, despite the presence of Coogler as an executive producer, we imagine he reserves the right to contradict anything revealed here in a subsequent Wakanda-set project (more on that below). The series will also establish the presence of an Iron Fist in the MCU, although it is unclear if this will undo the one featured in the Netflix Iron Fist series. Marvel Zombies (animated series) Premiere Date: October 2025 What We Know: Spinning off from a season 1 What If…? episode, various Marvel characters attempt to survive a zombie apocalypse. During the D23 Marvel Animation presentation mentioned above, the audience saw an extended clip establishing the fall of San Francisco and, five years later, Shang-Chi, Katy, and Jimmy Woo driving a zombie-infested version of the Fury Road. While it is unclear if the live action actors reprise their roles here, Iman Vellani is set to voice Kamala Khan, who is said to be central to the miniseries. Other characters trying to survive include Kate Bishop, Yelena Belova, and Blade(!).

While concrete story details are limited so far, the Russo Brothers' return to the MCU with Avengers: Doomsday promises to be a crossover event of unprecedented magnitude, with potentially hundreds of extremely powerful villains facing off against the biggest hero line-up ever united in the MCU timeline within one project. There can be no doubt that blood will be spilled. However, complications for Avengers: Doomsday arose based on Jonathan Majors' legal matters , as Majors was found guilty on two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault on December 18, 2023. Shortly after, reports came in that the MCU had cut ties with the actor going forward, and that Avengers: The Kang Dynasty would henceforth be Avengers 5 for the time being, with its new title of Avengers: Doomsday being announced months later. Avengers: Doomsday Latest News Marvel Studios Announces The Cast Of Doomsday Marvel Studios has officially announced the cast of Avengers: Doomsday and, like everyone thought, it features a massive list of characters, with a number of pleasant surprises thrown in for good measure. Included in the frankly absurdly large cast are various members of The Fantastic Four, Thunderbolts, Avengers, and even Fox's original X-Men characters . Of course, other major MCU characters that are typically not associated with a team will be in the film as well. Some of those names announced include Shang-Chi, Shuri, Loki, Thor, and more. Avengers: Doomsday was always thought to be a significant number of characters, but some of the ones announced were incredibly surprising, as it felt like Avengers: Secret Wars would be the one to really bring together characters from the entirety of Marvel's cinematic history. Doctor Doom is going to have his hands full. Avengers: Doomsday Release Date Getting Closer Every Year Doctor Doom descends from the sky wielding a sword, lighting cracking in the background. While it was originally set for release on May 2, 2025, Marvel shifted the Avengers: Doomsday release date to May 1, 2026 . Based on the story focusing on that of iconic Fantastic Four nemesis Doctor Doom, it seems the film will follow on directly from The Fantastic Four 's debut at the start of the MCU's Phase 6, though it's possible that another film could fill in the gap in late 2025, given that Blade was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule. Avengers: Doomsday Cast Info Promised To Be A Massive Cast Link Image Doctor Doom Avengers: Doomsday will revolve around Doctor Doom, who at the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con was announced to be part of the upcoming movie, hence its title. Doctor Doom's casting was also announced, with the iconic MCU Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. set to return to the cinematic universe in this new role . Bringing in Doctor Doom is seemingly a great lead-in to the Secret Wars storyline, as he's also been an antagonist in one of the comic iterations of this narrative. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have begun to talk about Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars , as recent interviews highlight some major points regarding Robert Downey Jr. being cast as Doctor Doom, a decision that has massive implications. In a recent interview with Omelete , Joe Russo talked about Kevin Feige's idea to bring back Robert Downey Jr., stating, \"That was Kevin [Feige], and interesting enough about that was, that conversation was had a while ago. And then Robert tried to talk us into doing it, and we said 'no,' weirdly because we said we wouldn't come back.\" The Fantastic Four All four members of The Fantastic Four will reprise their roles in Avengers: Doomsday. This includes Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing. Given how closely tied the group is with Doctor Doom, they will likely have some of the most significant roles in the entire film. The Thunderbolts Nearly all the Thunderbolts will be coming back for Avengers: Doomsday , which includes Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Wyatt Russell as US Agent, David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, and Lewis Pullman as Sentry. Unfortunately, Taskmaster didn't make the cut, indicating her time in Thunderbolts* will likely be cut short. The Avengers Despite the Avengers breaking up over the course of the MCU, Sam Wilson was determined to assemble a new team following Captain America: Brave New World , and he seems to be doing just that. Alongside Anthony Mackie as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Other Major MCU Characters Alongside the various MCU teams, like Thunderbolts and Avengers, there are a significant number of characters returning in Avengers: Doomsday that have played a significant role in the ", "url": "https://screenrant.com/avengers-doomsday-release-date-cast-story-details/", "domain": "screenrant.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 10, "title": "The Direct 2026's Marvel Studios Movies Will Bring Back 5 Original Avengers", "snippet": "2 weeks ago - While Phase 6 of the MCU kicked ... of fan-favorite Avengers actors in Spider-Man: Brand New Day releasing July 31 and Avengers: Doomsday coming to theaters on December 18....", "full_content": "In 2026, the MCU is returning to its roots with a nostalgic lineup of originalAvengers stars. As the Multiverse Saga approaches its climax, five familiar faces will enter the fray and in more than one movie. While Phase 6 of the MCU kicked off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsand is expected to conclude withAvengers: Secret Warsin 2027,Marvel Studios' 2026 slateis where the action ramps up thanks to the return of fan-favoriteAvengersactors inSpider-Man: Brand New Dayreleasing July 31 andAvengers: Doomsdaycoming to theaters on December 18. Given the Multiversal nature of these projects, fans don't yet know the full extent of all their roles, or just which characters they will play, but these five returning stars are giving longtime MCU fans a reason to get excited all over again. It's no secret amongst Marvel fans that Robert Downey Jr. is back in the MCU, but this time as the Multiversal villain Doctor Doom. While he's the headlining villain ofAvengers: Doomsday, his character has alreadyappeared inThe Fantastic Four: First Steps' post-credits sceneand possibly aboard the Fantastic Four ship in theThunderbolts*tag. The question now is whether he will appear inSpider-Man: Brand New Day, both in the movie or in another post-credits scene, and if Robert Downey Jr. could play another version of his villain or Earth-616 hero in the MultiversalDoomsday. Perhaps the biggest mystery on this list, Chris Evans is heavily rumored to be returning inAvengers: Doomsday; however, it's a claim that the original Captain America star has repeatedly denied. Adding to the fan speculation is the fact that Evans reprised his original Marvel role as Johnny Storm forDeadpool & Wolverinein 2024 and Peggy Carter star Hayley Atwell is already confirmed for the 2026 film. Furthermore, Marvel has yet to clarify his character's still-mysterious post-Endgamefate. Finally, there are rumors claiming Evans may be playingSteve Rogers' alternate identity of Nomad. Clearly, there are multiple ways Chris Evans could make an MCU comeback in 2026, and it will be interesting to see which, if any, prove to be true. Unlike some of his originalAvengersco-stars, Chris Hemsworth has continued Thor's story followingEndgamewithThor: Love and Thunderand is confirmed to pick up the hammer once more inAvengers: Doomsday. (check out the 61 stars confirmed and reported forAvengers 5here) Not only will it be interesting to see how he reacts to Multiversal versions of his former teammate, like Robert Downey Jr.'s Doom, butDoomsdaymay also allow him to finally reunite with his brother Loki. Following his role inShe-Hulkfor Disney+, Mark Ruffalo is headed back to the big screen in 2026 with a role alongside Tom Holland inSpider-Man: Brand New Day. However, Ruffalo may not be playing the Smart Hulk fans have grown accustomed to sinceAvengers: Endgame. Instead, there is some buzz that he may be playingthe destructive Savage Hulk forSpider-Man 4. Whether Ruffalo's Smart Hulk, Savage Hulk, or another version of the gamma-powered green giant will appear inAvengers: Doomsdayremains to be seen. According to reports, Nick Fury still has more to do within the MCU. While Marvel Studios has yet to confirm his role inDoomsday, Samuel L. Jackson is rumored for the 2026 film and where he could potentially bridge both the old and new eras of the MCU. It's also possible he will square off against Val (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) after she branded the Thunderbolts the New Avengers in 2025'sThunderbolts*.

The MCU has been struggling, and in a rather desperate move, decided to revert back to ‘Avengers’ movies — albeit without Iron Man, Captain America, and Hulk.\n\n“Avengers: Doomsday” wrapped its marathon shoot this year, rolling cameras from April 28 until mid-September. Setting aside potential reshoots, the film now gets a luxurious 15-month post-production “break.”\n\nWhy so much breathing room? Easy — after finishing ‘Doomsday,’ the Russo brothers immediately pivot to its follow-up, “Avengers: Secret Wars.” Both films are rumored to become the costliest in Hollywood history, with budgets said to be in excess of 500M+ (although understandably, we cannot confirm at this time).\n\nHollywood North Buzz now claims “Secret Wars” will mirror the same April-through-September shoot next year in Vancouver. Another 15-month post window. Another VFX behemoth. More endless cameos — it’s all dialed to 11. Expect reshoots, and barely a finished script.\n\nOh, and did I mention the second phase of filming for ‘Doomsday’ — in other words, reshoots — kicks off in January 2026? There were probably some rewrites, maybe even a reshuffled cast list, since Marvel has been locking pieces of this puzzle together right up until the very last second.\n\nThe official synopsis includes Robert Downey Jr.’s return to Marvel — but this time as Doom himself. Not much else is known about the story being told here. Stephen McFeely and Michael Waldron are credited on the screenplay(s).\n\nTo give perspective: “Avengers: Endgame” cost $356M to make. ‘Doomsday’ already has $90M publicly accounted for — $40M for the Russos, $50M for Robert Downey Jr. With the avalanche of names reportedly attached, I’d be shocked if the final tally is under $400M. And that’s me being conservative.\n\nMarvel continues to push the envelope: how many characters can they squeeze into a single movie before it collapses under its own weight?\n\nUpdated ‘Doomsday’ Cast:\n\nRobert Downey Jr. – Dr. Doom\n\nPedro Pascal – Reed Richards\n\nVanessa Kirby – Sue Storm\n\nEbon Moss-Bacharach – The Thing\n\nJoseph Quinn – Human Torch\n\nAnthony Mackie – Captain America\n\nChris Hemsworth – Thor\n\nLetitia Wright – Shuri\n\nPaul Rudd – Ant-Man\n\nSimu Liu – Shang-Chi\n\nDanny Ramirez – Falcon\n\nWinston Duke – M’Baku\n\nTenoch Huerta – Namor\n\nFlorence Pugh – Yelena Belova\n\nSebastian Stan – Bucky Barnes\n\nDavid Harbour – Red Guardian\n\nWyatt Russell – John Walker\n\nHannah John-Kamen – Ghost\n\nLewis Pullman – Sentry\n\nTom Hiddleston – Loki\n\nPatrick Stewart – Professor X\n\nIan McKellen – Magneto\n\nAlan Cumming – Nightcrawler\n\nRebecca Romijn – Mystique\n\nJames Marsden – Cyclops\n\nChanning Tatum – Gambit\n\nKelsey Grammer – Beast\n\nChris Evans – Captain America\n\nHayley Atwell – Captain Carter\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch – Doctor Strange\n\nRyan Reynolds – Deadpool\n\nThis doesn’t even include the speculated characters that could very well join the cast in the coming weeks, including Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda), Paul Bettany (Vision), Xochitl Gomez (America Chavez), Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), Tessa Thompson (Valkyrie), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye), Don Cheadle (War Machine), Karen Gillan (Nebula), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Danai Gurira (Okoye), Ke Huy Quan (Ouroboros), Teyonah Parris (Monica Rambeau), Will Poulter (Adam Warlock), Dominique Thorne (Ironheart), and Sophia Di Martino (Sylvie).\n\n“Avengers: Doomsday” hits theaters and IMAX on December 18, 2026. “Avengers: Secret Wars” is set to roll out on December 17, 2027.", "url": "https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/11/1/avengers-secret-wars-to-shoot-in-april", "domain": "worldofreel.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3521}, {"source_number": 12, "title": "ABC News Marvel announces Avengers: Doomsday cast featuring new stars and old legends - ABC News", "snippet": "March 27, 2025 - Marvel has announced its cast for Avengers: Doomsday , including franchise veterans alongside Fantastic Four newcomers and stalwarts from Fox's X-Men movies.

( AP: Uncredited ) In short: Marvel has announced its cast for Avengers: Doomsday, including franchise veterans alongside Fantastic Four newcomers and stalwarts from Fox's X-Men movies. The film is set to release in May 2026, with the sequel Avengers: Secret Wars to follow in May 2027. What's next? The films represent a moment of truth for Marvel Studios after falling box office returns and cooling critical reception to more recent projects. Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Anthony Mackie's Captain America, Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Hiddleston's Loki are all returning to the Avengers ensemble, where they are set to joined by several of cinema's original X-Men. The five veterans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are in the cast of 2026's Avengers: Doomsday, which Marvel announced in a series of videos rolled out slowly overnight. Loading Twitter content Patrick Stewart, 84, who played Professor X in Fox's early-2000s X-Men films, and 85-year-old Ian McKellen, who played his arch-nemesis Magneto, are also in the Doomsday cast as Disney and Marvel seek to take advantage of the acquisition of Fox's movie library. Kelsey Grammer, who played Hank \"Beast\" McCoy, was also announced, as was Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler). Their characters were taken on by younger actors in the 2010s X-Men series reboot. The more senior superheroes will be joined by more recent MCU additions, including some who have yet to make their debuts. Vanessa Kirby, set to play the Invisible Woman Sue Storm in this July's Fantastic Four: First Steps, will also appear in Avengers: Doomsday. Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards will join the Avengers too. Pedro Pascal will join the MCU in Fantastic Four: First Steps ahead of Avengers: Doomsday. ( Reuters: Guglielmo Mangiapane ) And they will be joined in both movies by Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who is playing Ben Grimm, aka the Thing, and Joseph Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch. Simu Liu, who played the title character in 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, is also in the newly announced cast, as is Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who played the aquatic antagonist Namor in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Letitia Wright, who plays Shuri in the Black Panther films, will also be back among the Avengers, as will other Black Panther alum Winston Duke. Florence Pugh, who will reprise her MCU role as Yelena Belova in the forthcoming Thunderbolts, will also appear in Doomsday, along with cast mate David Harbour as Red Guardian. Some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's biggest and most anticipated names were not among the 27 names announced, though Marvel and Disney could be sitting on them for now. There was no mention of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine or Ryan Reynolds's Deadpool, though the announcement did include Channing Tatum, who played the X-Men's Gambit in last year's Deadpool & Wolverine. Chris Evans was also absent from the cast list. Tom Holland's name did not appear either. Holland's Spider-Man became an Avenger in previous films. However, the character was on loan from owner Sony, whose complicated relationship with Marvel has made the intellectual property a sticking point. Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr announced he was returning to Marvel Cinematic Universe during the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con. ( Getty Images: Matt Winkelmeyer ) Robert Downey Jr revealed last summer that he will be returning to the MCU to play the villain Doctor Doom in the next set of Avengers films. Avengers: Doomsday, set for release in May 2026, will be the fifth Avengers movie, and the first since 2019's Avengers Endgame became one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Moment of truth for Marvel Marvel has been struggling to recover its cultural buzz and box office mojo ever since Endgame. However, it hopes the forthcoming ensemble films will bring back the magic that dominated cinema for more than a decade. The success of the first 23 films in the franchise — the Infinity Saga — has been difficult to emulate, with the so-called Multiverse Saga seeing the first box office flops in the studio's history: 2021's Eternals and 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Both films also copped \"rotten\" critic scores on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, another first for the MCU. Despite decent reviews , 2023's The Marvels was the MCU's lowest-grossing film ever, failing to break even on its more than $US300 million ($476.4 million) budget. The television offerings have also been mixed at best, with shows such as Loki and WandaVision earning good numbers and critical acclaim, and outings such as Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Secret", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-27/new-stars-old-legends-marvel-announces-avengers-doomsday-cast/105101532", "domain": "abc.net.au", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 5746}, {"source_number": 13, "title": "ComicBook.com All 7 Marvel Movie & TV Projects Releasing in 2026 - ComicBook.com", "snippet": "August 3, 2025 - Avengers: Doomsday is currently slated for release on December 18, 2026. 2026 is also set to feature the release of a new instalment of an existing MCU Disney+ series, with Daredevil: Born Again Season 2 scheduled to premiere in March.", "full_content": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe is undoubtedly one of the biggest and most successful franchises of all time. Having officially begun all the way back in 2008 with the release of Iron Man, its story has already spanned well over 100 hours of viewing across movies, TV shows, and various special features. It has grown into one of the most popular franchises in modern cinema, with its movies regularly breaking box office records and the franchise weaving itself a place in the fabric of pop culture as a result. As always, Marvel Studios are looking to the future, with several exciting projects on the horizon.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\n2026 is already shaping up to be an important year for the MCU. The year is set to see numerous releases for the franchise, bringing its story toward the conclusion of the Multiverse Saga as part of the build-up to Avengers: Secret Wars. Though there are still MCU releases set for late 2025, Marvel has also got some incredibly exciting projects currently slated for release in 2026.\n\nMarvel Movies Set for 2026 Release\n\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day (July 31, 2026)\n\nSpider-Man’s fourth solo movie in the MCU is one of the most anticipated projects in the franchise’s near future, largely due to the already exceptional MCU stories which have featured the hero. Subtitled Brand New Day, the movie is set to explore Spider-Man’s work as a New York hero after magically erasing his identity as Peter Parker. With the introduction of Mephisto into the MCU in Ironheart, Spider-Man: Brand New Day is now looking even more exciting, and is currently set for release on July 31, 2026.\n\nAvengers: Doomsday (December 18, 2026)\n\nWhat may well be one of the most exciting movies in the MCU is also set for a 2026 release in the form of Avengers: Doomsday. The movie is set to introduce long-awaited villain Doctor Doom into the MCU, with Robert Downey Jr. announced to be returning to play the iconic antagonist. Doomsday will also feature an expansive cast of existing MCU heroes, with various actors set to reprise their Marvel roles in the first part of the Multiverse Saga’s conclusion. Avengers: Doomsday is currently slated for release on December 18, 2026.\n\nMarvel TV Shows Set for 2026 Release\n\nDaredevil: Born Again Season 2 (March 2026)\n\n2026 is also set to feature the release of a new instalment of an existing MCU Disney+ series, with Daredevil: Born Again Season 2 scheduled to premiere in March. It will follow on directly from the end of Season 1, which saw Daredevil and Kingpin once again at odds in the MCU. Season 2 of the show will bring back the cast from first season and see Daredevil wage all-out war on Wilson Fisk in an attempt to thwart his plans for New York.\n\nVision Quest (TBC)\n\nThe MCU is set to finally resolve multiple dangling plot threads in 2026 with the release of Vision Quest. The series, which will feature Vision following his resurrection in WandaVision, will surely feature the return of other MCU characters, including the long-awaited revival of Ultron after his apparent demise in 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. The show has not yet been given a confirmed release date, but is still currently set for release in 2026 at the time of writing.\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Season 2 (TBC)\n\nEven before the first season had been released, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man was renewed for a second season, which is currently set for a 2026 release. With the first season having received glowing reviews, the animated show’s return is highly anticipated, with several exciting new characters also set to appear. An official release date has not been set, but Season 2 is currently slated for release some time in 2026.\n\nThe Punisher Special (TBC)\n\nAfter Punisher’s appearance in Daredevil: Born Again, Frank Castle’s MCU story has been confirmed as far from over. The vigilante anti-hero has always proved a fan favorite, with Jon Bernthal’s performance widely cited as one of the best iterations of the character. He is set to return to the MCU in a mid-length special presentation in the vein of Werewolf by Night and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. While an official date has not been set, it is currently tipped for a 2026 release.\n\nX-Men ‘97 Season 2 (TBC)\n\nSeason 1 of X-Men ’97 brought Marvel’s mutant heroes to the MCU in emphatic fashion, and though it was swiftly renewed for another season, a two-year wait was announced. That wait sets X-Men ’97 Season 2 up for release in 2026, even though a specific date has yet to be formally announced for the next instalment. Regardless, the popularity of Season 1 and the considerable wait for the follow-up makes X-Men ’97 Season 2 yet another exciting Marvel release slated for 2026.", "url": "https://comicbook.com/movies/news/marvel-movies-tv-shows-releasing-2026-list/", "domain": "comicbook.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 4731}, {"source_number": 14, "title": "The Walt Disney Company Marvel Studios Announces 'Avengers: Doomsday' Cast - The Walt Disney Company", "snippet": "March 27, 2025 - Marvel Studios announced Wednesday that production has begun on the film Avengers: Doomsday , in theaters May 1, 2026.

The Marvel movies of 2025 saw the franchise undergo somewhat of a resurgence, with the likes of Thunderbolts* and The Fantastic Four: First Steps being considered a critical return to form for the MCU. The upcoming Marvel movies of 2026 will look to continue this streak, with a slate of exciting projects planned. Despite only having two movies in 2026, Marvel Studios seems set for a good year. This will hopefully be reflected in the box office as much as audience and critical ratings, with many dreaming that 2026 will include two of the best-ranked MCU movies ever . This is without mentioning the various Marvel TV shows that will be released in 2026. 2025 was an illustrious year for Marvel in TV, with the franchise spawning several live-action series as well as a handful of animated efforts. With all that being said, here is a look forward to 2026 for Marvel Studios, from the feature films to the small-screen stories planned. Spider-Man: Brand New Day Tom Holland showing off his Spider-Man: Brand New Day (2026) suit The first Marvel Studios movie being released in 2026 is Spider-Man: Brand New Day . The story of Spider-Man: Brand New Day will follow on from 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home , chronicling Peter Parker's continued exploits in the MCU now that everyone on Earth has forgotten his existence. Directed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton, Spider-Man: Brand New Day is expected to hit theaters on July 31, 2026 . The exact plot of the film has been kept under wraps thus far, but it is expected to be a more street-level Spider-Man movie with Peter entering the next phase of his life. Tom Holland will reprise his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, with several new cast members for Spider-Man: Brand New Day confirmed. Jon Bernthal, Mark Ruffalo, and Michael Mando will reprise their previous MCU roles as The Punisher, Hulk, and Scorpion, respectively. Zendaya's MJ and Jacob Batalon's Ned will also return, though to what extent remains unknown. New cast members include Stranger Things' Sadie Sink and The Bear 's Liza Colon-Zayas. Spider-Man: Brand New Day will look to build on the highly successful Homecoming trilogy, ushering in a new age of the titular Web-Slinger in the MCU and potentially leading to another two movies in the franchise's second Spider-Man trilogy. Avengers: Doomsday Robert Downey Jr sitting in a set chair with the Avengers: Doomsday cast. There are only two Marvel movies in 2026, though they are two of the biggest. Alongside Spider-Man: Brand New Day , Avengers: Doomsday is scheduled to release in theaters on December 18, 2026 ​​​​​​. Avengers: Doomsday 's story has been teased throughout the last few MCU movies, setting up Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the franchise as the villainous Doctor Doom. Originally, Avengers: Doomsday was supposed to be the story of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty . However, Kang the Conqueror actor Jonathan Majors was fired by Marvel after his assault charges, leading to a change in direction. In July 2024, Marvel Studios confirmed Avengers: Doomsday with RDJ as the new Multiverse Saga villain and returning directors, the Russo Brothers, attached . Since then, Avengers: Doomsday 's cast list has been confirmed, with the film shaping up to tell the story of how The Avengers, the New Avengers, The Fantastic Four, and the X-Men will team up to stop whatever sinister plans Doom has for the multiverse. What Doom’s plan is remains to be seen, but The Fantastic Four: First Steps’ post-credit scene teased this. This scene showcased Doctor Doom appearing to Franklin Richards, the incredibly powerful, reality-altering son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm. With Avengers: Doomsday confirmed to tie into 2027's Avengers: Secret Wars, it is clear that Franklin will be important to Doom's plans. Shooting on Avengers: Doomsday is underway until late October 2025, priming the film for its 2026 release. Every MCU Show Releasing In 2026 Daredevil born again poster In comparison to previous years, the MCU is dialing back its TV productions in 2026. However, that is not to say there are none. Three Marvel Television productions are expected in 2026 , with two coming in live-action format and one being animated. Starting with the latter, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2 is expected in 2026. The first season of the animated show that focused on an alternate dimension's Peter Parker was released in January 2025. During an interview with Collider that year, Marvel Studios' Head of Television Brad Winderbaum confirmed that seasons of the show would come annually, with the second coming \"a little bit more than a year\" after its debut.

Having officially begun all the way back in 2008 with the release of Iron Man , its story has already spanned well over 100 hours of viewing across movies, TV shows, and various special features. It has grown into one of the most popular franchises in modern cinema, with its movies regularly breaking box office records and the franchise weaving itself a place in the fabric of pop culture as a result. As always, Marvel Studios are looking to the future, with several exciting projects on the horizon. Videos by ComicBook.com 2026 is already shaping up to be an important year for the MCU. The year is set to see numerous releases for the franchise, bringing its story toward the conclusion of the Multiverse Saga as part of the build-up to Avengers: Secret Wars . Though there are still MCU releases set for late 2025 , Marvel has also got some incredibly exciting projects currently slated for release in 2026. Marvel Movies Set for 2026 Release Spider-Man: Brand New Day (July 31, 2026) Spider-Man’s fourth solo movie in the MCU is one of the most anticipated projects in the franchise’s near future, largely due to the already exceptional MCU stories which have featured the hero. Subtitled Brand New Day , the movie is set to explore Spider-Man’s work as a New York hero after magically erasing his identity as Peter Parker. With the introduction of Mephisto into the MCU in Ironheart , Spider-Man: Brand New Day is now looking even more exciting, and is currently set for release on July 31, 2026. Avengers: Doomsday (December 18, 2026) What may well be one of the most exciting movies in the MCU is also set for a 2026 release in the form of Avengers: Doomsday . The movie is set to introduce long-awaited villain Doctor Doom into the MCU, with Robert Downey Jr. announced to be returning to play the iconic antagonist. Doomsday will also feature an expansive cast of existing MCU heroes, with various actors set to reprise their Marvel roles in the first part of the Multiverse Saga’s conclusion. Avengers: Doomsday is currently slated for release on December 18, 2026. Marvel TV Shows Set for 2026 Release Daredevil: Born Again Season 2 (March 2026) 2026 is also set to feature the release of a new instalment of an existing MCU Disney+ series , with Daredevil: Born Again Season 2 scheduled to premiere in March. It will follow on directly from the end of Season 1, which saw Daredevil and Kingpin once again at odds in the MCU. Season 2 of the show will bring back the cast from first season and see Daredevil wage all-out war on Wilson Fisk in an attempt to thwart his plans for New York. Read Next Marvel Just Forgot Endgame’s Rules of Time Travel (& Broke Them for a Second Time) Vision Quest (TBC) The MCU is set to finally resolve multiple dangling plot threads in 2026 with the release of Vision Quest . The series, which will feature Vision following his resurrection in WandaVision , will surely feature the return of other MCU characters , including the long-awaited revival of Ultron after his apparent demise in 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron . The show has not yet been given a confirmed release date, but is still currently set for release in 2026 at the time of writing. Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Season 2 (TBC) Even before the first season had been released, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man was renewed for a second season, which is currently set for a 2026 release. With the first season having received glowing reviews, the animated show’s return is highly anticipated, with several exciting new characters also set to appear. An official release date has not been set, but Season 2 is currently slated for release some time in 2026. The Punisher Special (TBC) After Punisher’s appearance in Daredevil: Born Again , Frank Castle’s MCU story has been confirmed as far from over. The vigilante anti-hero has always proved a fan favorite, with Jon Bernthal’s performance widely cited as one of the best iterations of the character. He is set to return to the MCU in a mid-length special presentation in the vein of Werewolf by Night and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special . While an official date has not been set, it is currently tipped for a 2026 release. X-Men ‘97 Season 2 (TBC) Season 1 of X-Men ’97 brought Marvel’s mutant heroes to the MCU in emphatic fashion, and though it was swiftly renewed for another season, a two-year wait was announced. That wait sets X-Men ’97 Season 2 up for release in 2026, even though a specific date has yet to be formally announced for the next instalment. Regardless, the popularity of Season 1 and the considerable wait for the follow-up makes X-Men ’97 Season 2 yet another exciting Marvel release slated for 2026. 10 Marvel Deaths That the MCU Should Change After Avengers: Secret Wars Tagged: Avengers: Doomsday , List Feature , Marvel Cinematic Universe , Spider-Man: Brand New Day Follow Us ", "url": "https://comicbook.com/movies/news/marvel-movies-tv-shows-releasing-2026-list/", "domain": "comicbook.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 5874}, {"source_number": 5, "title": "'Avengers: Doomsday' cast includes original X-Men and new ...", "snippet": "Mar 27, 2025 · Marvel has announced the return of some Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) stars in 2026 ' s \" Avengers : Doomsday,\" including Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Mackie as Captain America,...", "full_content": "close Video Rooftop Revelations: Marvel's new Captain America has a 'dangerous message' for children Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks blasts Captain America actor Anthony Mackie for a speech that guided America's youth 'not to bother trying' at life.

With the dust of Endgame settled and the Multiverse Saga heating up, all eyes are now on three colossal upcoming films that will define the next phase of the MCU: Spider-Man: Brand New Day , Avengers: Doomsday , and Avengers: Secret Wars . This powerful trio isn’t just a continuation of old stories — it’s a bold leap into uncharted territory. With legacy heroes returning, new faces stepping into the spotlight, and timelines possibly resetting, Marvel’s future has never looked more thrilling… or more chaotic. Spider-Man: Brand New Day – A New Chapter for Peter Parker Release Date : July 31, 2026 Directed by : Destin Daniel Cretton Starring : Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jon Bernthal, Sadie Sink, Jacob Batalon The next Spider-Man film is swinging into theaters with a fresh suit, a grounded tone, and a whole new direction for Peter Parker. After the memory-wipe twist in No Way Home , Brand New Day finds Peter starting over in college, trying to live a low-key life — until crime calls again. He won’t be alone. Jon Bernthal returns as The Punisher , adding serious grit to the mix, and rumors suggest Mister Negative may be the new central villain. With Sadie Sink joining the cast and nods to classic Spider-Man visuals from Sam Raimi’s era, this feels like a soft reboot that honors the past while setting up a deeper, more personal journey for Peter. It’s also being positioned as a narrative bridge before Avengers: Doomsday , likely tying street-level heroes into larger multiversal events. Peter may not stay grounded for long. Avengers: Doomsday – The War of Universes Begins Release Date : December 18, 2026 Directed by : The Russo Brothers Major Cast : Pedro Pascal (Reed Richards), Letitia Wright (Shuri), Florence Pugh (Yelena), Robert Downey Jr. (Doctor Doom) Yes, you read that right. Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the MCU — but not as Iron Man. Instead, he’s taking on the dark, complex role of Doctor Doom . This twist alone is enough to ignite fan theories across the internet, but there’s more. Avengers: Doomsday will bring together a staggering lineup: the Fantastic Four, New Avengers, Thunderbolts, X-Men variants, Wakandans, and even rumored cameos from legacy characters. The film will center around a multiversal incursion, with Doctor Doom and Franklin Richards playing key roles in a cosmic battle threatening the fabric of the MCU. This movie isn’t just about heroes punching bad guys. It’s about consequences — the cost of tampering with timelines, and the moral gray areas of survival when realities collide. Marvel is taking its time with this one, pushing the release back to ensure the visual effects and storytelling live up to the hype.

Release Date : December 17, 2027 Directed by : The Russo Brothers Writer : Stephen McFeely Rumored Surprise : Full MCU reboot incoming? Secret Wars is shaping up to be more than a finale — it might be the finale of the current MCU era as we know it. After Doomsday tears the multiverse apart, Secret Wars will attempt to stitch it back together — or destroy it entirely. This film is expected to pull in heroes from every universe: Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Men, Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine, the Fox X-Men lineup, and countless variants. But the biggest twist? Marvel insiders hint this will serve as a full continuity reset . That means the end of some beloved actors in their roles (goodbye, perhaps, to Holland’s Peter or Hemsworth’s Thor), and a fresh start with new castings for Iron Man, Cap, and others in a rebooted universe post-2028. Think of Secret Wars as the MCU’s version of a hard system restart — closing the Multiverse Saga with a bang so it can start over, bigger and bolder.

They’re strategic pieces of Marvel’s grand storytelling engine. Each one builds momentum for the next — with Brand New Day laying groundwork, Doomsday exploding the world(s), and Secret Wars rewriting the rulebook. Marvel is playing the long game here. After a rocky reception to some recent projects ( cough Eternals, Thunderbolts ), they’ve realigned priorities: fewer releases, more polish, bigger stakes.

Avengers: Doomsday plot – what will Avengers 5 be about? Avengers: Doomsday trailer – any Avengers 5 footage yet? Avengers: Doomsday might have been delayed until December 2026 , but we have now at least had our first look at Doctor Doom in the MCU . The mid-credit scene of The Fantastic Four: First Steps marks Doctor Doom's MCU debut, although we only see him from behind. Avengers: Doomsday started filming in late April after its unique cast announcement that featured a lot of chairs, including some exciting X-Men additions and major omissions . During Marvel's Comic-Con panel in July 2024, it was confirmed that Joe and Anthony Russo were back to direct Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars . What's more, Robert Downey Jr is back, but not as Iron Man... as Doctor Doom. The Russos are taking over from original director Destin Daniel Cretton, who left the movie in November 2023. Stephen McFeely has written the script, taking over from Jeff Loveness, but Michael Waldron is also helping on Doomsday 's script. The pair will also be writing Avengers: Secret Wars . The next Avengers movie is half of a double bill that will bring The Multiverse Saga to a close , but before we can even start thinking of Secret Wars , there's a lot that needs to be done with Avengers: Doomsday . Here's everything you need to know about Avengers : Doomsday . Alberto E. Rodriguez // Getty Images Sign up to Disney+ Avengers: Doomsday release date – when can we expect Avengers 5? As mentioned above, Avengers: Doomsday has been hit by another release date delay and will now land in cinemas on 18 December 2026 . That's a seven-month delay from the previous release date of 1 May 2026, which itself was a year delay from the original 2 May 2025 release . The delay has also impacted Avengers: Secret Wars which will now land in cinemas on 17 December 2027 instead of 7 May 2027. Filming has at least now started on Avengers: Doomsday and like the Infinity War / Endgame double-bill, filming is planned to start on Avengers: Secret Wars pretty soon after Doomsday wraps. \"We're shooting them fairly back-to-back, it's a lot of work again, we may or may not survive, we'll see,\" Joe Russo confirmed in March 2025 . Marvel Studios Avengers: Doomsday cast – who is joining Robert Downey Jr in Avengers 5? Let's start with the massive news. Robert Downey Jr has been confirmed to play iconic Marvel villain Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday . We don't know exactly how it'll work yet, but it wouldn't be a surprise if this Doctor Doom comes from whatever world the upcoming Fantastic Four movie takes place in. It remains to be seen if Victor Von Doom is a Tony Stark variant. Jesse Grant // Getty Images We had to wait until March 2025 for further official cast additions, but we now know thanks to a bunch of chairs that the following MCU stars are coming back for Avengers: Doomsday : • Chris Hemsworth (Thor) • Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman) • Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America) • Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes) • Letitia Wright (Shuri/Black Panther) • Paul Rudd (Scott Lang/Ant-Man) • Wyatt Russell (John Walker/US Agent) • Tenoch Huerta Mejía (Namor) • Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) • Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) • Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova) Marvel Studios • Kelsey Grammer (Hank McCoy/Beast) • Lewis Pullman (Robert 'Bob' Reynolds/Sentry) • Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres/Falcon) • Joseph Quinn (Johnny Storm/Human Torch) • David Harbour (Red Guardian) • Winston Duke (M'Baku) • Hannah John-Kamen (Ava Starr/Ghost) • Tom Hiddleston (Loki) • Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier/Professor X) • Ian McKellen (Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto) • Alan Cumming (Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler) • Rebecca Romijn (Raven Darkhölme/Mystique) • James Marden (Scott Summers/Cyclops) • Channing Tatum (Remy LeBeau/Gambit) • Pedro Pascal (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic) The presence of the Thunderbolts* and The Fantastic Four casts aren't a surprise, given Feige confirmed they'd be in the Avengers movies at Comic-Con 2024 , but the OG X-Men returns are the ones to get fans most excited. We're still missing some major names that were widely expected to be in Avengers: Doomsday , such as Tom Holland's Spider-Man . However, Downey Jr teased future cast announcements to come in March 2025, but nobody else has been announced yet. Sony Pictures // Marvel Studios Who could those additional stars be? It's unclear at this point, but plenty of MCU stars have been having their say on potential returns. There have been reports that Chris Evans will reprise his role as Steve Rogers in the new movie, but he's denied those .

We break down everything we know about every Marvel movie and TV show currently in the works. by Erik Amaya | May 22, 2025 | Comments TAGGED AS: Marvel , MCU , movies , streaming , TV [Updated August 1, 2025] The story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel Studios itself has been a tumultuous one since the release of Avengers: Endgame . The Phase Four films and television shows left audiences wondering if there was a new saga at all . The need to generate material for Disney+ also left many feeling the studio was unfocused and overextended, something studio president Kevin Feige would partially admit in 2025. Nevertheless, at SDCC 2022, he tried to quell some of these misgivings by revealing the full calendar for Phases Five and Six, labeling the whole thing as “The Multiverse Saga.” But almost as soon as the Multiverse calendar was made public, alterations were made. Movies shifted release dates and production schedules. Two industry strikes forced all television and movie production to grind to halt. Disney itself changed its priorities and instructed Marvel to slow its pipeline. The expected big bad of the new saga, Kang the Conqueror, proved unimpressive in his true debut appearance — Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — while the actor who portrayed him faced criminal charges in New York. He was ultimately let go from his Marvel contract, but it was unclear if Kang would carry on or be completely replaced with a difference character. And it just so happened that Doctor Doom seemed to be the logical replacement and Robert Downey Jr. was available… It all reveals that, despite the planning involved, Marvel Studios is malleable and ready to alter those plans if need be. Meanwhile, back in the MCU, heroes must rise, ne’er-do-wells must do what they do, and Marvel’s First Family must finally take its moment in the spotlight. And, as we have for the last few years, we’re keeping track of it all in this comprehensive guide of every upcoming Marvel Studios film (and television show) with a handy calendar of the studio’s projects through 2027 (and beyond). As always, we will continue to update this page frequently as new details emerge. And be careful: There are spoilers ahead. (Want to see what the other camp is up to? Check out our full breakdown of upcoming DC Studios movies .) WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT In Phase Six And beyond The SDCC 2024 presentation was full of bombast — from a Deadpool choir singing “Like A Prayer” to the Downey as Doom reveal — but was surprisingly short on words like “phase”, “Multiverse”, and “saga.” Consequently, it is unclear if that system of notation is still in place. What you can expect in lieu of phases is the end of the current saga in two upcoming Avengers films and the return of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in his fourth MCU outing. Also, there are a few TV shows readying for release that may still matter to the ongoing threads of Marvel storytelling… Although it remains unclear if phases remain part of the studio’s reported seven year calendar, we’re holding onto the nomenclature for all the projects set for release after First Steps until Feige offers an update on this aspect of the Marvel Method. Eyes of Wakanda (animated series) Premiere Date: August 6, 2025 What We Know: The anthology miniseries focuses on different protectors of Wakanda throughout its history. A clip shown at the 2024 D23 Marvel Animation presentation revealed a female Black Panther protecting her nation’s vibranium resources during the Age of Piracy, for example. Former Marvel storyboard artist Todd Harris serves as the series director and creator while Black Panther director Ryan Coogler serves as an executive producer. In July 2025, Disney released the first trailer for the series. How It Fits in the MCU: Unlike the other animated programs, Eyes of Wakanda details the history of Wakanda within the MCU. Of course, despite the presence of Coogler as an executive producer, we imagine he reserves the right to contradict anything revealed here in a subsequent Wakanda-set project (more on that below). The series will also establish the presence of an Iron Fist in the MCU, although it is unclear if this will undo the one featured in the Netflix Iron Fist series. Marvel Zombies (animated series) Premiere Date: October 2025 What We Know: Spinning off from a season 1 What If…? episode, various Marvel characters attempt to survive a zombie apocalypse. During the D23 Marvel Animation presentation mentioned above, the audience saw an extended clip establishing the fall of San Francisco and, five years later, Shang-Chi, Katy, and Jimmy Woo driving a zombie-infested version of the Fury Road. While it is unclear if the live action actors reprise their roles here, Iman Vellani is set to voice Kamala Khan, who is said to be central to the miniseries. Other characters trying to survive include Kate Bishop, Yelena Belova, and Blade(!).

While concrete story details are limited so far, the Russo Brothers' return to the MCU with Avengers: Doomsday promises to be a crossover event of unprecedented magnitude, with potentially hundreds of extremely powerful villains facing off against the biggest hero line-up ever united in the MCU timeline within one project. There can be no doubt that blood will be spilled. However, complications for Avengers: Doomsday arose based on Jonathan Majors' legal matters , as Majors was found guilty on two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault on December 18, 2023. Shortly after, reports came in that the MCU had cut ties with the actor going forward, and that Avengers: The Kang Dynasty would henceforth be Avengers 5 for the time being, with its new title of Avengers: Doomsday being announced months later. Avengers: Doomsday Latest News Marvel Studios Announces The Cast Of Doomsday Marvel Studios has officially announced the cast of Avengers: Doomsday and, like everyone thought, it features a massive list of characters, with a number of pleasant surprises thrown in for good measure. Included in the frankly absurdly large cast are various members of The Fantastic Four, Thunderbolts, Avengers, and even Fox's original X-Men characters . Of course, other major MCU characters that are typically not associated with a team will be in the film as well. Some of those names announced include Shang-Chi, Shuri, Loki, Thor, and more. Avengers: Doomsday was always thought to be a significant number of characters, but some of the ones announced were incredibly surprising, as it felt like Avengers: Secret Wars would be the one to really bring together characters from the entirety of Marvel's cinematic history. Doctor Doom is going to have his hands full. Avengers: Doomsday Release Date Getting Closer Every Year Doctor Doom descends from the sky wielding a sword, lighting cracking in the background. While it was originally set for release on May 2, 2025, Marvel shifted the Avengers: Doomsday release date to May 1, 2026 . Based on the story focusing on that of iconic Fantastic Four nemesis Doctor Doom, it seems the film will follow on directly from The Fantastic Four 's debut at the start of the MCU's Phase 6, though it's possible that another film could fill in the gap in late 2025, given that Blade was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule. Avengers: Doomsday Cast Info Promised To Be A Massive Cast Link Image Doctor Doom Avengers: Doomsday will revolve around Doctor Doom, who at the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con was announced to be part of the upcoming movie, hence its title. Doctor Doom's casting was also announced, with the iconic MCU Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. set to return to the cinematic universe in this new role . Bringing in Doctor Doom is seemingly a great lead-in to the Secret Wars storyline, as he's also been an antagonist in one of the comic iterations of this narrative. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have begun to talk about Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars , as recent interviews highlight some major points regarding Robert Downey Jr. being cast as Doctor Doom, a decision that has massive implications. In a recent interview with Omelete , Joe Russo talked about Kevin Feige's idea to bring back Robert Downey Jr., stating, \"That was Kevin [Feige], and interesting enough about that was, that conversation was had a while ago. And then Robert tried to talk us into doing it, and we said 'no,' weirdly because we said we wouldn't come back.\" The Fantastic Four All four members of The Fantastic Four will reprise their roles in Avengers: Doomsday. This includes Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing. Given how closely tied the group is with Doctor Doom, they will likely have some of the most significant roles in the entire film. The Thunderbolts Nearly all the Thunderbolts will be coming back for Avengers: Doomsday , which includes Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Wyatt Russell as US Agent, David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, and Lewis Pullman as Sentry. Unfortunately, Taskmaster didn't make the cut, indicating her time in Thunderbolts* will likely be cut short. The Avengers Despite the Avengers breaking up over the course of the MCU, Sam Wilson was determined to assemble a new team following Captain America: Brave New World , and he seems to be doing just that. Alongside Anthony Mackie as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Other Major MCU Characters Alongside the various MCU teams, like Thunderbolts and Avengers, there are a significant number of characters returning in Avengers: Doomsday that have played a significant role in the ", "url": "https://screenrant.com/avengers-doomsday-release-date-cast-story-details/", "domain": "screenrant.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 11, "title": "The Direct 2026's Marvel Studios Movies Will Bring Back 5 Original Avengers", "snippet": "2 weeks ago - While Phase 6 of the MCU kicked ... of fan-favorite Avengers actors in Spider-Man: Brand New Day releasing July 31 and Avengers: Doomsday coming to theaters on December 18....", "full_content": "In 2026, the MCU is returning to its roots with a nostalgic lineup of original Avengers stars. As the Multiverse Saga approaches its climax, five familiar faces will enter the fray and in more than one movie.\n\nWhile Phase 6 of the MCU kicked off with The Fantastic Four: First Steps and is expected to conclude with Avengers: Secret Wars in 2027, Marvel Studios' 2026 slate is where the action ramps up thanks to the return of fan-favorite Avengers actors in Spider-Man: Brand New Day releasing July 31 and Avengers: Doomsday coming to theaters on December 18.\n\nGiven the Multiversal nature of these projects, fans don't yet know the full extent of all their roles, or just which characters they will play, but these five returning stars are giving longtime MCU fans a reason to get excited all over again.\n\n5 Original Avengers Stars Returning in 2026\n\nRobert Downey Jr.\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nIt's no secret amongst Marvel fans that Robert Downey Jr. is back in the MCU, but this time as the Multiversal villain Doctor Doom. While he's the headlining villain of Avengers: Doomsday, his character has already appeared in The Fantastic Four: First Steps' post-credits scene and possibly aboard the Fantastic Four ship in the Thunderbolts* tag. The question now is whether he will appear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, both in the movie or in another post-credits scene, and if Robert Downey Jr. could play another version of his villain or Earth-616 hero in the Multiversal Doomsday.\n\nChris Evans\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nPerhaps the biggest mystery on this list, Chris Evans is heavily rumored to be returning in Avengers: Doomsday; however, it's a claim that the original Captain America star has repeatedly denied. Adding to the fan speculation is the fact that Evans reprised his original Marvel role as Johnny Storm for Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024 and Peggy Carter star Hayley Atwell is already confirmed for the 2026 film. Furthermore, Marvel has yet to clarify his character's still-mysterious post-Endgame fate. Finally, there are rumors claiming Evans may be playing Steve Rogers' alternate identity of Nomad. Clearly, there are multiple ways Chris Evans could make an MCU comeback in 2026, and it will be interesting to see which, if any, prove to be true.\n\nChris Hemsworth\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nUnlike some of his original Avengers co-stars, Chris Hemsworth has continued Thor's story following Endgame with Thor: Love and Thunder and is confirmed to pick up the hammer once more in Avengers: Doomsday. (check out the 61 stars confirmed and reported for Avengers 5 here) Not only will it be interesting to see how he reacts to Multiversal versions of his former teammate, like Robert Downey Jr.'s Doom, but Doomsday may also allow him to finally reunite with his brother Loki.\n\nMark Ruffalo\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nFollowing his role in She-Hulk for Disney+, Mark Ruffalo is headed back to the big screen in 2026 with a role alongside Tom Holland in Spider-Man: Brand New Day. However, Ruffalo may not be playing the Smart Hulk fans have grown accustomed to since Avengers: Endgame. Instead, there is some buzz that he may be playing the destructive Savage Hulk for Spider-Man 4. Whether Ruffalo's Smart Hulk, Savage Hulk, or another version of the gamma-powered green giant will appear in Avengers: Doomsday remains to be seen.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nAccording to reports, Nick Fury still has more to do within the MCU. While Marvel Studios has yet to confirm his role in Doomsday, Samuel L. Jackson is rumored for the 2026 film and where he could potentially bridge both the old and new eras of the MCU. It's also possible he will square off against Val (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) after she branded the Thunderbolts the New Avengers in 2025's Thunderbolts*.", "url": "https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-movies-2026-avengers-actors", "domain": "thedirect.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3751}, {"source_number": 12, "title": "World of Reel ‘Avengers: Secret Wars’ to Shoot in April 2026 — Will There Even Be A Script? — World of Reel", "snippet": "12 hours ago - Marvel), Danai Gurira (Okoye), Ke Huy Quan (Ouroboros), Teyonah Parris (Monica Rambeau), Will Poulter (Adam Warlock), Dominique Thorne (Ironheart), and Sophia Di Martino (Sylvie). “ Avengers: Doomsday ” hits theaters and IMAX on December 18, 2026.", "full_content": "Marvel’s mega–two-part endgame machine keeps on going. The MCU has been struggling, and in a rather desperate move, decided to revert back to ‘Avengers’ movies — albeit without Iron Man, Captain America, and Hulk.\n\n“Avengers: Doomsday” wrapped its marathon shoot this year, rolling cameras from April 28 until mid-September. Setting aside potential reshoots, the film now gets a luxurious 15-month post-production “break.”\n\nWhy so much breathing room? Easy — after finishing ‘Doomsday,’ the Russo brothers immediately pivot to its follow-up, “Avengers: Secret Wars.” Both films are rumored to become the costliest in Hollywood history, with budgets said to be in excess of 500M+ (although understandably, we cannot confirm at this time).\n\nHollywood North Buzz now claims “Secret Wars” will mirror the same April-through-September shoot next year in Vancouver. Another 15-month post window. Another VFX behemoth. More endless cameos — it’s all dialed to 11. Expect reshoots, and barely a finished script.\n\nOh, and did I mention the second phase of filming for ‘Doomsday’ — in other words, reshoots — kicks off in January 2026? There were probably some rewrites, maybe even a reshuffled cast list, since Marvel has been locking pieces of this puzzle together right up until the very last second.\n\nThe official synopsis includes Robert Downey Jr.’s return to Marvel — but this time as Doom himself. Not much else is known about the story being told here. Stephen McFeely and Michael Waldron are credited on the screenplay(s).\n\nTo give perspective: “Avengers: Endgame” cost $356M to make. ‘Doomsday’ already has $90M publicly accounted for — $40M for the Russos, $50M for Robert Downey Jr. With the avalanche of names reportedly attached, I’d be shocked if the final tally is under $400M. And that’s me being conservative.\n\nMarvel continues to push the envelope: how many characters can they squeeze into a single movie before it collapses under its own weight?\n\nUpdated ‘Doomsday’ Cast:\n\nRobert Downey Jr. – Dr. Doom\n\nPedro Pascal – Reed Richards\n\nVanessa Kirby – Sue Storm\n\nEbon Moss-Bacharach – The Thing\n\nJoseph Quinn – Human Torch\n\nAnthony Mackie – Captain America\n\nChris Hemsworth – Thor\n\nLetitia Wright – Shuri\n\nPaul Rudd – Ant-Man\n\nSimu Liu – Shang-Chi\n\nDanny Ramirez – Falcon\n\nWinston Duke – M’Baku\n\nTenoch Huerta – Namor\n\nFlorence Pugh – Yelena Belova\n\nSebastian Stan – Bucky Barnes\n\nDavid Harbour – Red Guardian\n\nWyatt Russell – John Walker\n\nHannah John-Kamen – Ghost\n\nLewis Pullman – Sentry\n\nTom Hiddleston – Loki\n\nPatrick Stewart – Professor X\n\nIan McKellen – Magneto\n\nAlan Cumming – Nightcrawler\n\nRebecca Romijn – Mystique\n\nJames Marsden – Cyclops\n\nChanning Tatum – Gambit\n\nKelsey Grammer – Beast\n\nChris Evans – Captain America\n\nHayley Atwell – Captain Carter\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch – Doctor Strange\n\nRyan Reynolds – Deadpool\n\nThis doesn’t even include the speculated characters that could very well join the cast in the coming weeks, including Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda), Paul Bettany (Vision), Xochitl Gomez (America Chavez), Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), Tessa Thompson (Valkyrie), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye), Don Cheadle (War Machine), Karen Gillan (Nebula), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Danai Gurira (Okoye), Ke Huy Quan (Ouroboros), Teyonah Parris (Monica Rambeau), Will Poulter (Adam Warlock), Dominique Thorne (Ironheart), and Sophia Di Martino (Sylvie).\n\n“Avengers: Doomsday” hits theaters and IMAX on December 18, 2026. “Avengers: Secret Wars” is set to roll out on December 17, 2027.", "url": "https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/11/1/avengers-secret-wars-to-shoot-in-april", "domain": "worldofreel.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3521}, {"source_number": 13, "title": "ABC News Marvel announces Avengers: Doomsday cast featuring new stars and old legends - ABC News", "snippet": "March 27, 2025 - Marvel has announced its cast for Avengers: Doomsday , including franchise veterans alongside Fantastic Four newcomers and stalwarts from Fox's X-Men movies.

( AP: Uncredited ) In short: Marvel has announced its cast for Avengers: Doomsday, including franchise veterans alongside Fantastic Four newcomers and stalwarts from Fox's X-Men movies. The film is set to release in May 2026, with the sequel Avengers: Secret Wars to follow in May 2027. What's next? The films represent a moment of truth for Marvel Studios after falling box office returns and cooling critical reception to more recent projects. Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Anthony Mackie's Captain America, Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Hiddleston's Loki are all returning to the Avengers ensemble, where they are set to joined by several of cinema's original X-Men. The five veterans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are in the cast of 2026's Avengers: Doomsday, which Marvel announced in a series of videos rolled out slowly overnight. Loading Twitter content Patrick Stewart, 84, who played Professor X in Fox's early-2000s X-Men films, and 85-year-old Ian McKellen, who played his arch-nemesis Magneto, are also in the Doomsday cast as Disney and Marvel seek to take advantage of the acquisition of Fox's movie library. Kelsey Grammer, who played Hank \"Beast\" McCoy, was also announced, as was Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler). Their characters were taken on by younger actors in the 2010s X-Men series reboot. The more senior superheroes will be joined by more recent MCU additions, including some who have yet to make their debuts. Vanessa Kirby, set to play the Invisible Woman Sue Storm in this July's Fantastic Four: First Steps, will also appear in Avengers: Doomsday. Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards will join the Avengers too. Pedro Pascal will join the MCU in Fantastic Four: First Steps ahead of Avengers: Doomsday. ( Reuters: Guglielmo Mangiapane ) And they will be joined in both movies by Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who is playing Ben Grimm, aka the Thing, and Joseph Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch. Simu Liu, who played the title character in 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, is also in the newly announced cast, as is Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who played the aquatic antagonist Namor in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Letitia Wright, who plays Shuri in the Black Panther films, will also be back among the Avengers, as will other Black Panther alum Winston Duke. Florence Pugh, who will reprise her MCU role as Yelena Belova in the forthcoming Thunderbolts, will also appear in Doomsday, along with cast mate David Harbour as Red Guardian. Some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's biggest and most anticipated names were not among the 27 names announced, though Marvel and Disney could be sitting on them for now. There was no mention of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine or Ryan Reynolds's Deadpool, though the announcement did include Channing Tatum, who played the X-Men's Gambit in last year's Deadpool & Wolverine. Chris Evans was also absent from the cast list. Tom Holland's name did not appear either. Holland's Spider-Man became an Avenger in previous films. However, the character was on loan from owner Sony, whose complicated relationship with Marvel has made the intellectual property a sticking point. Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr announced he was returning to Marvel Cinematic Universe during the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con. ( Getty Images: Matt Winkelmeyer ) Robert Downey Jr revealed last summer that he will be returning to the MCU to play the villain Doctor Doom in the next set of Avengers films. Avengers: Doomsday, set for release in May 2026, will be the fifth Avengers movie, and the first since 2019's Avengers Endgame became one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Moment of truth for Marvel Marvel has been struggling to recover its cultural buzz and box office mojo ever since Endgame. However, it hopes the forthcoming ensemble films will bring back the magic that dominated cinema for more than a decade. The success of the first 23 films in the franchise — the Infinity Saga — has been difficult to emulate, with the so-called Multiverse Saga seeing the first box office flops in the studio's history: 2021's Eternals and 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Both films also copped \"rotten\" critic scores on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, another first for the MCU. Despite decent reviews , 2023's The Marvels was the MCU's lowest-grossing film ever, failing to break even on its more than $US300 million ($476.4 million) budget. The television offerings have also been mixed at best, with shows such as Loki and WandaVision earning good numbers and critical acclaim, and outings such as Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Secret", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-27/new-stars-old-legends-marvel-announces-avengers-doomsday-cast/105101532", "domain": "abc.net.au", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 5746}, {"source_number": 14, "title": "Marvel Studios’ ‘Avengers: Doomsday’ Begins Production", "snippet": "Mar 26, 2025 · Marvel Studios announced Wednesday that production has begun on the upcoming film Avengers: Doomsday , in theaters May 1, 2026.

Tuesday's post by the couple - who have been together for two years - has been liked more than 28 million times on the social media platform. NFL star Kelce is pictured getting down on one knee to pop the question to the world-famous music superstar, with the pair gazing into each other's eyes and embracing. In the third picture in the carousel, Swift, wearing a Ralph Lauren halter neck dress and diamond encrusted Cartier watch, flashes her engagement ring - a cushion cut diamond on a gold band.\n\n@TaylorSwift/Instagram\n\nAccording to US reports, the ring was purchased from Artifex Fine Jewelery. Prices for rings on its website start at around $29,000 (£21,506.26). Photos show the couple surrounded by roses, anemones, delphiniums and hydrangeas which appear to be set up in woodland with strategically placed urns and an archway, wedding florist Nicola Paul told the BBC. \"It's simple elegance, not too ostentatious,\" she said. \"It's been staged in the woods, so you get that lush greenery look.\" Celebrity florist Jeff Leatham, who has worked with the Kardashians, described the design as \"beautiful, hidden secret garden with a romantic mix of florals\". The engagement post was not without some elements of an Easter egg hunt - a thing Swift loves doing for her fans around the world. The caption had the explosion emoji which could also be read as TNT - or T and T: Taylor's and Travis' initials when abbreviated. Neither Swift nor Kelce have been publicly engaged to anyone before.\n\n'Feel so high school'\n\nAccompanying the Instagram post is Swift's ballad So High School from the Tortured Poets Department album - rumoured to have been written about Kelce. \"I feel so high school every time I look at you,\" she sings. The clip of the song finishes on the line \"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?\" which apparently is a reference to a 2016 interview in which Kelce chose to kiss Taylor in a game of Kiss, Marry, Kill. \"That was so magical and special to see,\" said Dr Iona Murphy, an adviser on last year's Victoria and Albert Museum's exhibition on Swift and a superfan who has written about Swift. \"A song that was written about Travis was now being used on the post. It's a nice full circle moment,\" said Dr Murphy, an English literature lecturer at Huddersfield University. She said the caption to the Instagram announcement - \"your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married\" – is also notable, as it refers to how the fans like to describe the couple. \"That's like a little joke in the fandom. You see it on social media. So it's like that was a little nod to the fans,\" she said. In an interview with ABC's News 5 Cleveland station, Kelce's father, Ed, revealed that \"Travis actually did the proposal... maybe two weeks, not quite two weeks ago\". He said this happened at a garden in the city of Lee's Summit, Missouri. \"He got her out there, they were about to go out to dinner, and he said, 'let's go out and have a glass of wine'... they got out there, and that's when he asked her, and it was beautiful,\" Ed Kelce said. \"They started FaceTiming me and their mother and her folks to make sure everybody knew. So, to see them together is great.\"\n\n@TaylorSwift/Instragram\n\nFans scream in shock\n\nThe pop emergency has resonated with fans in an extraordinary way. Videos on social media show groups of friends screaming as they heard the news, while others describe feeling emotional and even teary. \"I thought it was AI when I first opened up Instagram,\" Chloe, who runs a Swiftie news fan account with 74,000 followers on TikTok, told the BBC. \"I couldn't believe it was real, then I realised it was their accounts that posted it,\" she said. \"I immediately freaked out and text my group chat incoherently. Just excitement and disbelief, really.\" As the news broke, many Swift fans were joking on social media that they were happy for their \"close friend\" Swift. Swift recognised early on in her career the benefit of connecting with fans, and has carefully crafted a sense of relatability. And at the same time, many of Swift's original fans - who were teenagers at the same time as Swift was breaking through as an artist - have grown up with her, and are now at the same age when they may also be getting engaged or married. Explaining why she felt so strongly about the engagement, Chloe said: \"I feel in a way we all know her. \"Her music is so personal, and the way she connects to her fans is through the way she talks and ", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzdpk3xwjo", "domain": "bbc.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 7325}, {"source_number": 3, "title": "BBC Taylor Swift announces engagement to Travis Kelce - BBC News", "snippet": "August 27, 2025 - \" Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married \", the singer writes in a post on Instagram.", "full_content": "Taylor Swift is engaged, sending fans into frenzy\n\n\"Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.\"\n\nWith that one-line, five-picture Instagram post, signed off with a fire cracker emoji, Taylor Swift announced her engagement to American football player Travis Kelce, sending the internet into a frenzy.\n\nSwift, wearing a Ralph Lauren halter neck dress and diamond encrusted Cartier watch, flashes her engagement ring in the photos.

The image, which went viral, was from the nuptials of Chicago Bears player Cole Kmet and Emily Jarosz last Saturday. Event planner Ellie Nottoli shared the photo, revealing an invite that named \"Taylor and Travis Kelce\" at Table 13 - Taylor's lucky number. Notably absent from the invite was Swift's surname, sparking intense fan speculation. Ellie's post added fuel to the fire by mentioning: \"We all know Taylor and Travis were at a different wedding in Tennessee.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nBut each guest had an envelope that was adhered to a beautiful backdrop, and Emily wrote love notes to all of her guests.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSwifties didn't hold back their excitement and shock, with one fan blurting out, \"TAYLOR AND TRAVIS KELCE? ! ? ? ? ? ?

Meanwhile, another simply queried, \"'They got married ?\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, not everyone was convinced. One fan suggested that the omission of Taylor's last name was merely for the \"aesthetic\".\n\nAnother chimed in, saying if they were indeed married, it should technically be \"'Technically it should be Travis and Taylor Kelce.\"\n\nThe couple first made their relationship public in 2023. Since then, they've been a solid team, often spotted at games and concerts whenever their hectic schedules permit.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey even shared a sweet Super Bowl smooch that left fans swooning, and Travis has been seen joining Taylor on stage during her Eras Tour. Before they officially became a couple, Travis revealed on his podcast \"New Heights,\" that he attempted to give Swift his number through a friendship bracelet at one of her concerts, only to find out she doesn't speak before or after performances to preserve her voice.\n\nBut fate gave him another shot, and his persistence paid off, leaving Swift impressed. Fans went into a frenzy in November of the same year when Taylor tweaked the lyrics of \"Karma\" during a concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nShe changed the line from \"Karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me\" to \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe singer was later seen rushing over to her beau for a passionate kiss.\n\nThe couple's public displays of affection escalated over the following months, culminating in a 2024 selfie featuring Taylor, Travis, Prince William, and his two eldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at her London concert. This marked the NFL star's first official appearance on her Instagram feed.\n\nTheir relationship has only grown stronger since then, and the latest rumors of an engagement have Swifties worldwide eagerly awaiting confirmation.\n\nArticle continues below", "url": "https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-secretly-1200612", "domain": "themirror.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3515}, {"source_number": 6, "title": "StyleCaster The Truth to Rumors Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce Are Secretly Married After She Went by ‘Taylor Kelce’", "snippet": "June 10, 2025 - On June 9, 2025 , wedding planners ... knot in secret.

an NFL insider casually mentioned it. A simple wedding detail sparked one of this year's biggest celebrity rumors. Social media is currently on fire as people attempt to distinguish between fact and fiction.It's possible that Travis Kelce's NFL friend unintentionally revealed that Taylor Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end are secretly married, as per a report by Page Six.Swift and Kelce were listed as guests at Chicago Bears player Cole Kmet's wedding to Emily Jarosz on Saturday, according to information shared by his event planner, Ellie Nottoli.Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift sparked marriage rumors after a wedding planner handed out a calligraphed envelope at a teammate's event. The personalized detail sparked speculation.At the ceremony, the planner unveiled the personalized touches, such as a letter with a \"Table 13\" assignment that was addressed to \"Taylor and Travis Kelce\" in exquisite calligraphy.In a Monday Instagram Story video, Nottoli stated, \"As everyone knows, Taylor and Travis attended another wedding in Tennessee.\" However, Emily wrote love notes to each of her guests on an envelope that was affixed to a lovely background. \"Many fans were enraged by the letter reveal because they thought Swift and Kelce might have already married.\"Travis Kelce and Taylor????\" \"EXCUSE [sic] ME,\" exclaimed one.But not everybody was persuaded. “This is very common for couples (married and unmarried) for weddings. it’s the aesthetic,\" someone else commented.A third person added, \"Even though we aren't married, my boyfriend and I do that too on gifts and stuff, just kind of for the aesthetic of it.\"\"Technically it should be Travis and Taylor Kelce,\" complained another.It turns out that the NFL player and his pop-star girlfriend did not attend Kmet's wedding on Saturday. Instead, the two attended the wedding of Tanner Corum, Kelce's cousin, in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Friday.Taylor Swift was wearing a blue floral strapless dress from Markarian for the event, while Kelce was dressed casually in slacks and a quarter-sleeved shirt, according to social media photos of the well-known couple.Two weeks after an insider hinted at the potential date of Kelce's proposal to the singer, there are now marriage rumors. When Kelce finishes playing football, the conversation will be the main focus, an insider told the Daily Mail in May.There is no confirmation.

I don’t know how best to talk about it. I mean, I’m aware of people’s… of that size of interest, and that world existing.\n\n\"It’s just not something I particularly care about, or have much interest in feeding, I guess, because the more it’s fed, the more you are opening a gate for intrusion. I think that’s just my response to a culture that has this increasing expectation that everything is going to be given.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Joe revealed that he liked when Taylor wrote songs about him. When asked by The Sunday Times if he minded being her subject matter for her music, he said: “No, not at all.

He wrote under the pseudonym William Bowery.\n\nSwift has avoided talking about Alwyn in interviews, and speaking to The Guardian about her decision, she said: “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.\" When Taylor's Miss Americana documentary was released on Netflix, Taylor gave an insight into how her and Joe's relationship started in 2016, after her bitter Snapchat fallout with Kim Kardashian.\n\n“I felt alone, I felt really bitter,” she said. “I felt sort of like a wounded animal lashing out. I figured I had to reset everything. I had to reconstruct an entire belief system for my own personal sanity. I also was falling in love with someone who had a wonderfully normal, balanced life.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn 2020 she hinted that Joe helped inspired her song Peace, while talking to Paul McCartney for Rolling Stone. She explained the song “is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living.\"\n\nTayl", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/taylor-swift-secretly-engaged-joe-27375372", "domain": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 6310}, {"source_number": 4, "title": "Who is Taylor Swift Husband in 2024 | The Journal Bharat", "snippet": "In December 2023, there were rumors that Taylor Swift secretly married Joe Alwyn, one of Swift ’s Exes.

A practice ramp was constructed in a quarry in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, stuffed with fall-breaking plastic bags, before taking on the actual leap off the Helsetkopen in Norway. Cruise performed the stunt six times for the cameras.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Everybody was trying to hold their breath’: Cruise rides a motorbike off a cliff, then freefalls down. Photograph: Christian Black/Paramount Pictures/Avalon\n\nAmy Johnston, a stunt performer on films such as Suicide Squad, Deadpool and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as well as the TV series Westworld, said: “In the movie theatre where I watched the film, as soon as he dropped, the audience was just dead silent. Everybody was trying to hold their breath, kind of they all felt like they were just having a heart attack.\n\n“What he is able to do is create spectacle, and he knows how to entertain people. He did some of his biggest stunts to date in this film, and I was absolutely very impressed.”\n\nCruise has been making Mission: Impossible films for nearly 30 years, and will be for another 20 if he has his way. Since the premiere of the first Mission: Impossible in 1996, the role has been particularly testing, with the series renowned for its elaborate and physically challenging stunts, for which Cruise, 61, prides himself on his personal involvement. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh entry in the series, carries on the tradition, with other set pieces including a somersaulting Fiat 500, and train carriages hanging over a steep drop.\n\nJohnston points out that while Cruise will have stunt doubles to assist him, as well as elements of CGI to heighten impact, the fact that he gets involved so heavily himself has an influence on the way scenes are filmed and their impact. “He knows how to bring the realism – you can see that it’s happening to him in closeup, like the effect of freefall on his face - and then you can also keep the frame very wide and see the action play out. It adds to the experience, and audiences definitely feel that.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Very impressed’: actor and stunt performer Amy Johnston.\n\nFor all that, Johnston says one of the hardest stunts in the film is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment at the very start, when Cruise’s character, hiding in the desert, has to mount a horse as it gets up from a prone position. “This is very specialty-trained movement; it really needs timing, and it’s dangerous as well, because the horse could lay down on his leg if the timing is off.\n\n“That is what Cruise always brings to his films, the extra details, because he didn’t need to do that. But he wants to do those things, and it adds a lot.”\n\nJohnston also talks admiringly of the car chase scene in which Cruise and Hayley Atwell are handcuffed together as they manoeuvre a Fiat 500 around the narrow streets of Rome. “It was really fun, and not just because of all the somersaults and car hits, but the fact they were connected by handcuffs was so creative. I would love to break it down frame by frame, but I think that Cruise was definitely driving one-handed while being handcuffed. That whole scene [was a] really great job by the stunt coordinators and the stunt performers.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Really fun’: Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in their handcuffed car chase. Photograph: Paramount Pictures/Avalon\n\nJohnston says that a scene in which Cruise fights a selection of bad guys on top of a speeding train employed a mix of stunt trickery and actual exposure to the conditions. She suggests that film-makers may have employed harnesses or wires attached to a crane, which are then erased in post-production, for wide shots, and that greenscreen backdrops, where the background is added digitally, were probably used for tighter shots. “But the part where he had to duck under a bridge is one of those things that you have to really work on and go over and over and over and really get the timing right. It’s very scary to do something like that.”\n\nJohnston is also supportive of the stunt industry’s campaign to gain recognition for its work through inclusion in the Oscars, which is spearheaded by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. “It would make a lot of sense, especially with how hard the stunt teams work ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/14/expert-verdict-tom-cruise-mission-impossible-stunts-amy-johnston", "domain": "theguardian.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 5744}, {"source_number": 2, "title": "DW 'Mission: Impossible': Tom Cruise and stunt-performing stars", "snippet": "July 13, 2023 - In 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol' (2011), Tom Cruise climbs up the world's tallest building · A highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump .", "full_content": "In \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning\" superstar Tom Cruise once again does his own stunts.

One of the aspects that makes the series so popular is that Tom Cruise performs many of the film stunts himself, without the aid of CGI or stunt doubles. That approach has turned him into an action megastar.\n\nDaring action scenes\n\nUnforgettable scenes in the previous movies include Tom Cruise climbing up the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, or hanging from a plane as it takes off.\n\nIn 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol' (2011), Tom Cruise climbs up the world's tallest building Image: David James/Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nA highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump.\n\nLike the \"John Wick\" films with Keanu Reeves, the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise counters the trend of having blockbuster action scenes created exclusively through CGI.\n\nCruise is perhaps the most famous action star doing his own stunts today. But other actors, including older ones, also insist on filming dangerous sequences themselves in order to make the movie feel more authentic.\n\nJackie Chan: Stunt legend despite serious accident\n\nThis includes Chinese martial arts legend Jackie Chan, who has insisted on doing practically all of his stunts himself since the 1970s.\n\nHis most notable performances are in \"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow\" (1978), \"Police Story\" and \"Police Story 2\" (1985 and 1988) and \"Armour of God\" (1986).\n\nDuring the filming of the latter, Chan almost died while filming a relatively simple stunt. Jumping from a ledge onto a tree, he fell and crashed onto a rock, breaking a few ribs and cracking his skull.\n\nJackie Chan in 'Amour of God,' 1986 Image: Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nMichelle Yeoh: Former 'Bond girl' and martial arts legend\n\nIn her Oscar-winning role in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" 60-year-old Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh portrays a laundromat owner who in an alternate universe is also a famous martial arts movie star — inspired by the actress' own career.\n\nMichelle Yeoh in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (2000), which will be re-released in theaters in 2023 Image: Columbia Films/Entertainment Pictures/ZUMAPRESS/picture alliance\n\nYeoh, who is also among the stars renowned for performing stunts herself, played alongside Jackie Chan in action classics like \"Police Story 3: Supercop\" or \"Supercop 2.\" She rose to international prominence with the 2000 martial arts film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" in which she also did her own stunts.\n\nKeanu Reeves: 'I do all of the action'\n\nCanadian actor Keanu Reeves doesn't shy away from getting his hands dirty in action-packed scenes either. In films like \"Speed\" (1994), \"Matrix\" (1999) or the \"John Wick\" series, he jumps out of moving cars and fights his opponents in nerve-wracking scenes.\n\nIn 'Chain Reaction' (1996), Reeves escapes an explosion on a motorcycle Image: TBM/United Archives/picture alliance\n\nFollowing the release of \"John Wick 3,\" Reeves confirmed in an interview that he did almost all of the stunt work himself: \"I do all of the action. I'm 90 percent of what's happening there. I'm maintaining the connection to the audience, and with the story.\"\n\nHarrison Ford: Stuntman at 80\n\n\"Indiana Jones\" star Harrison Ford can't be left out of any list of actors performing their own stunts.\n\nThe 80-year-old actor has had an impressive film career spanning six decades. His most successful films include the \"Star Wars\" saga and the \"Indiana Jones\" series.\n\nHarrison Ford shot this iconic opening scene from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' 10 times Image: Paramount/Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nThe opening scene of the first Indiana Jones movie,\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is particularly iconic, with Harrison Ford running away from a giant boulder that is chasing him. Even though the rock was a prop, it was still heavy enough to seriously injure the actor, who was not doubled in the scene.\n\nFord completely immersed himself in the role of daredevil archeologist Indiana Jones.\n\nIn the recently released \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" he still took over many stunts himself, dislocating his shoulder while filming.

The Mission: Impossible franchise has thus become synonymous with his name, and his breathtaking dedication to provide audiences with a spectacle worthy of going to the movie theatre.\n\nAnd the eighth and latest installment of the franchise, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning (2025) has truly raised the bar – Tom’s spectacular stunts for the film has just awarded the accomplished athlete with a Guinness World Records title for most burning parachute jumps by an individual.\n\nThe star leapt out of a helicopter 16 times while strapped to a parachute pre-soaked in fuel and lit ablaze, before cutting away the charred remnants of the first chute and safely deploying a backup. No other actor or stuntman has come close to that amount of death-defying drops, and his dedication was rewarded with the record title on 4 June.\n\n“Tom doesn't just play action heroes – he is an action hero!” said Craig Glenday, Editor-in-Chief of Guinness World Records. “A large part of his success can be chalked up to his absolute focus on authenticity and pushing the boundaries of what a leading man can do. It's an honour to be able to recognize his utter fearlessness with this new Guinness World Records title.”\n\nCruise and his crew are no strangers to these amazing aerial action shots, especially after Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018), when Tom became the first actor to ever complete a HALO drop (high altitude, low open) on camera. To replicate the feeling of a secret spy mission, the team used an actual military tactic of flying extremely high to 25,000 ft, then dropping Tom, who plummets downwards at 200 MPH to below 2,000 ft before deploying his parachute to sneak into a country without being detected.\n\n“The audience can tell when something’s been cheated, so it’s important to be doing it all for-real,” said Wade Eastwood, Second Unit Director / Stunt Coordinator for Fallout.\n\nYet despite the risk, Tom always leaps headfirst into his challenges – the star has been a licensed skydiver for many years, and he completed hundreds of jumps in preparation for his latest stunt.\n\nFilming for The Final Reckoning took place in Drakensberg, South Africa, and the team spent weeks planning and preparing a sequence where they would take Tom up in a helicopter to a minimum of 7,500 ft before dropping him while attached to a flaming parachute.\n\nThe parachute was pre-soaked in fuel and lit ablaze, and after his life-net incinerated, Tom would cut away the burning fabric and deploy a backup chute to break his landing. But when skydiving from a moving vehicle, time is of the essence – and the parachute could only burn for 2.5 to 3 seconds before completely disintegrating.\n\nWith so many moving pieces in play, Tom and the Mission: Impossible crew completed fiery 16 drops in the quest for the perfect action shot. And in some of these jumps, he even has a 50 lb snorri camera rig attached to his body to capture a close-up look of the exhilarating fall.\n\nThe result is a breathtaking scene of a spy – and a very famous face – spiraling into an Icarus-like descent before saving himself at the very last moment from the grips of fate and the cold hard ground.", "url": "https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/6/hollywood-legend-tom-cruise-becomes-record-holder-for-his-fiery-mission-impossible-stunt", "domain": "guinnessworldrecords.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3894}, {"source_number": 4, "title": "People Look Back at Tom Cruise's 16 Most Exhilarating 'Mission: Impossible' Stunts — Including Which Scared Him the Most", "snippet": "May 25, 2025 - In PEOPLE’s special issue on the franchise, Cruise explained why he continues doing his own stunts. “ People feel the authenticity .

Over the franchise's 30-year span, Cruise has done everything from dangling from a wire in Mission: Impossible to motorcycling off a cliff in Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nIn PEOPLE’s special issue on the franchise, Cruise explained why he continues doing his own stunts.\n\n“People feel the authenticity. You feel the dedication and joy in learning something and then creating. That is something that I tell artists all the time: Don’t ask permission to create,” he said. “If you’re interested in dancing and singing, do it. I will learn a skill, and I know eventually I’m going to use it in a movie.”\n\nHere's everything to know about Tom Cruise’s most exhilarating stunts in the Mission: Impossible franchise.\n\nMission: Impossible escape from exploding aquarium\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible' (1996). Murray Close/Getty\n\nIn 1996, Cruise's Hunt kicked off his franchise with one of its most iconic stunts to date.\n\nAfter being accused of being a mole, Hunt creates a distraction by using an exploding stick of gum to blow up an aquarium. He jumps through a glass window, with 16 gallons of water propelling him outwards.\n\nThe scene was so dangerous that co-producer Paula Wagner told PEOPLE that Cruise hurt his foot while shooting it.\n\nMission: Impossible wire dangling\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible' (1996). Murray Close/Getty\n\nIn the very first movie, Cruise's Hunt created another famous moment when he dangled from a cable attached to his vest while retrieving a list containing all the identities of the IMF’s secret agents. While doing so, Hunt couldn't touch the ground or set off heat sensors, making for a breathtaking stunt.\n\nCruise told PEOPLE that the scene was partially inspired by actual trapeze artists.\n\n“There were things I wanted to introduce into Mission: that cable and vest I had for the CIA scene? That’s a vest I’d seen going to Cirque du Soleil in the ‘80s,” he said.\n\nMission: Impossible train jump\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible' (1996). Alamy\n\nIn the original movie’s finale, Hunt attempts to confront the real mole Jim (Jon Voight) on top of a train. He does so by luring a helicopter into a tunnel, then jumping from the helicopter onto the train.\n\nTo make this happen, Cruise repeatedly swung across a stage, landing hard each time. But co-writer David Koepp told PEOPLE that Cruise was smiling between takes.\n\n“He’s incredibly persistent and focused, and he’ll drive you completely insane because he keeps coming at it and at it and at it,” Koepp said.\n\nMission: Impossible II cliff-climbing\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible II' (2000). © Globe Photos/ZUMAPRESS.com\n\nThe first sequel in the Mission: Impossible franchise began with a shocking scene in which Cruise free-climbs a 2,000-ft. rock face in Utah. Although Cruise was wearing a harness — which was edited out — the scene was still extremely dangerous, especially considering Cruise did it with an injured foot.\n\n“I’m climbing up the side of that thing, we had gale force winds, and Sherry [Lansing, then head of Paramount], who’s my dear friend, kept trying to have me come up with a different sequence instead of rock climbing, because it was so dangerous,” Cruise told PEOPLE.\n\nMission: Impossible II knife fight\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible II' (2000). Alamy\n\nIn Mission: Impossible II, Hunt fights with the film’s villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) on a beach, which leads to Ambrose attacking Hunt with a knife. The knife was attached to a cable and measured to be seemingly less than an inch away from Cruise’s eyeball.\n\nCruise told PEOPLE that this is the franchise’s most underrated stunt. “In M:I-2, with the knife going [so near] my eye, that’s a real knife, not a computer-generated image. How we figure out to get that knife that close to the eye, there’s technical things all of us accomplish together.”\n\nMission: Impossible III swinging and parachuting from skyscrapers\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible III' (2006). PARAMOUNT PICTURES / VAUGHAN, STEPHEN\n\nIn Mission: Impossible III, Hunt makes a daring escape after retrieving the coveted Rabbit's Foot. To do so, he leaps off of one skyscraper in Shanghai, swings to another via a fulcrum and slides down the building’s roof while shooting villains.\n\nHunt subsequently parachutes into the next building, messily sticking a dangerous landing.\n\nMission: Impossible III bridge run\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible III' (2006).

Now, at 62, Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt for one final mission – and he’s still doing his own stunts.\n\nWith Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, the saga reaches its high-stakes finale. But behind the scenes of death-defying spectacles lies a fascinating question: just how far can the human body be pushed – and trained – to pull off the seemingly impossible?\n\nAnd at what cost? In filming the eight Mission: Impossible films, Cruise has suffered a broken ankle, cracked ribs and a torn shoulder.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to consider the capabilities – and limits – of the human body in being able to achieve these awesome heights. How much is it possible to train to achieve the apparently impossible?\n\nGet your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox.

Cruise wanted to film this all in one take and sought help from freediving instructors in order to hold his breath for the required time – over six minutes!\n\nThe average human can hold their breath for about 30 to 90 seconds. That’s without training. Although there’s an innate diving reflex built into the human body that allows it to temporarily adapt to immersion underwater.\n\nThe response is to lower the heart rate and redirect blood to the body’s core, essentially enabling it to lower its metabolic demand and preserve the function of the vital organs, like the brain and heart.\n\nAll well and good, but consider now the need to swim, as well as resist the pressure of the water pressing on the lungs. And also while fighting that desperate urge as a result of rising CO₂ to take a deep breath – which, underwater, would be catastrophic.\n\nAnd if the diver’s oxygen levels fall too low, they might black out and lose consciousness. That’s why shallow water drowning is a real risk here.\n\nThat’s where freediving training comes into play. With practice, there are several ways you can increase the time you’re able to remain underwater. These include mastering breathing techniques to retain the maximum amount of air in the lungs. Sustained practice might also lead to increased oxygen storage capacity in the bloodstream.\n\nThis process takes months to years to attain and might lengthen the immersion time, on average, to around five minutes. What Cruise managed to achieve was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nFree climbing – and that scene\n\nMission Impossible films often open with Ethan Hunt working his way up some impossibly sheer building or cliff face with the agility of a mountain goat. He appears to be free climbing without a harness, and at the start of Mission: Impossible 2, clinging on with just one hand. While Cruise used safety wires to secure himself, the climbing was 100% real.\n\nThen, of course, how could we forget that scene? The one in the original Mission: Impossible – where he has to suspend all limbs, centimetres from the ground, to prevent himself from setting off the alarms.\n\nAlthough Cruise hasn’t revealed his specific training regime for these stunts that I can see – performing any of these actions would require an exceptionally strong back and core.\n\nThe muscles of our backs keep the spine straight and upright. Some span the space between back and limb, such as latissimus dorsi, or “lats”. These sheets of muscle, prized by bodybuilders, are also particularly valuable to climbers – allowing you to perform a chin-up, or pull yourself up that rock face.\n\nBesides this, many other muscles are needed for extreme climbing – those that enable a strong grip, allow for reaching and “push offs”, and maintain tension and hold. It’s no wonder climbing is considered one of the best whole-body workouts.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Cruise is known to have trained extensively for this. To understand even an element of the difficulty he may have faced, you could try adopting that vault heist pose, with your belly in contact with the floor, and see how long you can hold it. I won’t tell you how pitiful my own attempt was.\n\nParamount Pictures/Alamy\n\nWhat a blast\n\nHunt has also escaped a fair few explosions in his time, from a helicopter in the Channel tunnel to a detonating fish tank in Prague. In Mission: Impossible 3, on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, another helicopter launching a missile triggers an explosion that sends Hunt smashing into a car. Again, Cruise did it all himself, for the price of two cracked ribs.\n\nPyrotechnics were used for the explosion, but of course, they couldn’t be used to lift Cruise up and deposit him against the car. The solution? A series of wires were used to drag him sideways.

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nFrom climbing the world's tallest building to clinging to the wing of a plane in flight and even jumping on Oprah's couch — there's a reason why Tom Cruise is the last great action star.\n\nIt's simple: stunts.\n\nIn the 15 years since the release of 2011's \"Ghost Protocol,\" the fourth \"Mission: Impossible\" film, Cruise has done increasingly hair-raising stunts in each of his new movies.\n\nEarlier in his career, Cruise acted in a greater mix of genres, including the 1994 horror \"Interview with the Vampire,\" the 1996 comedy-drama \"Jerry Maguire,\" and the 1999 erotic thriller \"Eyes Wide Shut.\" In that era, he was considered widely a sex symbol.\n\nNow, he trades in extraordinary feats.\n\n\"I'm always pushing,\" Tom Cruise told Business Insider in 2023 on the red carpet for \"Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning.\"\n\n\"Every time they say, 'Can you top it? Can you not top it?' We're always pushing. Every film I do, whatever genre it's in, I want to make it as entertaining as possible for that audience. I know I can do things better,\" he said.\n\nAnd it's a winning tactic. \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in which Cruise flew in real fighter jets, raked in $1.5 billion in 2022, while \"Dead Reckoning,\" where he leapt off a mountain on a motorbike, made $567 million.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nIn \"Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning,\" which is out on Friday, Cruise performs two nerve-shredding stunts: a scuba dive into the wreck of a submarine that rolls down into an ocean trench, and the climactic third act, where his character clings on to a biplane in flight.\n\nIt's expected to make $80 million in its opening weekend, The Hollywood Reporter reported, citing the National Research Group.\n\nCruise's enduring star power can even grab the attention of the most seasoned industry insiders. Rob Mitchell, the director of theatrical insights at film tech company Gower St. Analytics, recalled working as a sales analyst at Paramount in 2011, when employees did a set visit to see Cruise climb the Burj Khalifa.\n\n\"Everyone was taking pictures inside the Burj Khalifa, with Tom Cruise outside waving in,\" he told BI.\n\nThese sorts of stunts signal to audiences that Cruise is a bona fide star who is hardworking and takes his craft seriously—all ingredients of a movie more likely to be worth their hard-earned cash.\n\nReferring to \"Mission: Impossible,\" Mitchell said: \"There comes a point where people aren't really going for the story as much as they are for the excitement and the thrills.\"\n\n\"In an era dominated by CGI superheroes, Cruise's staying power lies in the 'authenticity' of his performances,\" Stuart Joy, the course leader of film and TV at Solent University, UK, told BI. \"Like Christopher Nolan, he champions analogue filmmaking in a digital age. But while Nolan does so behind the camera through practical effects and large-format film, Cruise embodies it on screen through real stunts and real danger.\"\n\nCruise's dedication to filmmaking has taken him around the world. During an interview at the BFI in London in May, he said he would \"force\" studios to send him to different countries to learn how movies were made there.\n\nHe also said encourages younger stars to \"spend time in the editing room, produce a movie, study old movies, recognize what the composition is giving you, know what those lenses are, understand the lighting and how to use it for your benefit.\"\n\nLast year, Cruise's \"Top Gun: Maverick\" costar Glen Powell told GQ that he was sent to a theater in Los Angeles to watch a six-hour \"film-school\" movie that Cruise made just for his friends.\n\n\"[Cruise] is like: 'Do we all agree that this is what a camera is? This is the difference between a film camera and a digital camera…' The funniest part is on flying. It was like he put together this entire flight school. So he would literally go 'OK, this is what a plane is. Here's how things fly. Here's how air pressure works,'\" Powell said.\n\nCentering his career around stunts is a smart PR move\n\nAs well as being undeniably impressive, stunts help to keep past controversies out of the conversation, Joy said.\n\n\"Cruise's transition from character-driven roles to stunt-centered performances seems intentional, not just as a creative decision but as a deliberate attempt to recalibrate public perceptions of his star persona,\" he said.\n\n\"After the mid-2000s controversies (most infamously the Oprah's sofa moment and scrutiny of his ties to Scientology) Cruise has successfully redirected the audience's attention,\" Joy added, referring to the moment in 2005 when he jumped on Winfrey's sofa while talking about his love for his then-girlfriend, and now ex-wife, Katie Holmes.\n\n\"Rather than inviting emotional connection through vulnerability, he now earns our praise and admiration through the s", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-cruise-own-stunts-real-mission-impossible-scientology-career-relevant-2025-5", "domain": "businessinsider.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 5683}, {"source_number": 8, "title": "Deseret News Tom Cruise hangs from airplane in ‘Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning’ trailer.

The answer is inevitably: something difficult and dangerous.\n\nYears ago, when Cruise and McQuarrie were beginning to sketch out the plot of 2018’s Mission: Impossible—Fallout, Cruise proposed a helicopter chase: his character in the films, Ethan Hunt, pursuing a bad guy, played by Henry Cavill, while both of them were aloft. As a rule, in Mission: Impossible, stunts are real: meaning they are performed by the actual actors involved, at least when possible, and when they are being done by Tom Cruise, that means all the time. “He’s the only actor in the world who is actually going to do everything,” Fraser Taggart, the series’s director of photography, told me.\n\nIn the Mission: Impossible franchise alone, Cruise has climbed the shiny glass sides of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building; hung from the side of an A400 military transport plane as it took off; and ridden an actual motorcycle off the edge of an actual Norwegian cliff. He has a commercial pilot license. He is one of 36 people in history to be named an honorary US naval aviator. He can parachute and BASE jump and free dive. But one issue with this particular idea for Fallout was that Cruise, at the time, was not trained as a helicopter pilot.

With each subsequent Ethan Hunt adventure, we get more stories (like this one, from the pages of GQ) about Tom Cruise doing something extremely risky in order to enthrall an audience, whether he's learning to hold his breath underwater for six minutes or scaling the exterior of the world's tallest building.\n\nIn the series' seventh installment, Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Hunt states to a character that their life “will always be more important to me than my own,” which feels like a declaration of Cruise’s guiding philosophy when it comes to stunt work. Recall Matt Damon's story about a dinner conversation he had with Cruise about a stunt in Ghost Protocol and the safety coordinator who deemed the stunt too dangerous for Cruise to execute; the punch line of that story is Cruise telling Damon “So, I get a new safety guy.”\n\nCruise fulfills his mission statement in the latest and purportedly final Mission: Impossible film, Mission: Impossible — Final Reckoning, by first hanging off the wing of a biplane and then jumping from it to another, nearby plane—establishing a new benchmark for both blockbuster-film stunt performance and actorly self-endangerment. As the franchise races into the sunset on a speeding bullet train, we’ve ranked the craziest stunts from the Mission series by degree of danger, from least to most.\n\n11.

A practice ramp was constructed in a quarry in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, stuffed with fall-breaking plastic bags, before taking on the actual leap off the Helsetkopen in Norway. Cruise performed the stunt six times for the cameras.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Everybody was trying to hold their breath’: Cruise rides a motorbike off a cliff, then freefalls down. Photograph: Christian Black/Paramount Pictures/Avalon\n\nAmy Johnston, a stunt performer on films such as Suicide Squad, Deadpool and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as well as the TV series Westworld, said: “In the movie theatre where I watched the film, as soon as he dropped, the audience was just dead silent. Everybody was trying to hold their breath, kind of they all felt like they were just having a heart attack.\n\n“What he is able to do is create spectacle, and he knows how to entertain people. He did some of his biggest stunts to date in this film, and I was absolutely very impressed.”\n\nCruise has been making Mission: Impossible films for nearly 30 years, and will be for another 20 if he has his way. Since the premiere of the first Mission: Impossible in 1996, the role has been particularly testing, with the series renowned for its elaborate and physically challenging stunts, for which Cruise, 61, prides himself on his personal involvement. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh entry in the series, carries on the tradition, with other set pieces including a somersaulting Fiat 500, and train carriages hanging over a steep drop.\n\nJohnston points out that while Cruise will have stunt doubles to assist him, as well as elements of CGI to heighten impact, the fact that he gets involved so heavily himself has an influence on the way scenes are filmed and their impact. “He knows how to bring the realism – you can see that it’s happening to him in closeup, like the effect of freefall on his face - and then you can also keep the frame very wide and see the action play out. It adds to the experience, and audiences definitely feel that.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Very impressed’: actor and stunt performer Amy Johnston.\n\nFor all that, Johnston says one of the hardest stunts in the film is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment at the very start, when Cruise’s character, hiding in the desert, has to mount a horse as it gets up from a prone position. “This is very specialty-trained movement; it really needs timing, and it’s dangerous as well, because the horse could lay down on his leg if the timing is off.\n\n“That is what Cruise always brings to his films, the extra details, because he didn’t need to do that. But he wants to do those things, and it adds a lot.”\n\nJohnston also talks admiringly of the car chase scene in which Cruise and Hayley Atwell are handcuffed together as they manoeuvre a Fiat 500 around the narrow streets of Rome. “It was really fun, and not just because of all the somersaults and car hits, but the fact they were connected by handcuffs was so creative. I would love to break it down frame by frame, but I think that Cruise was definitely driving one-handed while being handcuffed. That whole scene [was a] really great job by the stunt coordinators and the stunt performers.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘Really fun’: Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in their handcuffed car chase. Photograph: Paramount Pictures/Avalon\n\nJohnston says that a scene in which Cruise fights a selection of bad guys on top of a speeding train employed a mix of stunt trickery and actual exposure to the conditions. She suggests that film-makers may have employed harnesses or wires attached to a crane, which are then erased in post-production, for wide shots, and that greenscreen backdrops, where the background is added digitally, were probably used for tighter shots. “But the part where he had to duck under a bridge is one of those things that you have to really work on and go over and over and over and really get the timing right. It’s very scary to do something like that.”\n\nJohnston is also supportive of the stunt industry’s campaign to gain recognition for its work through inclusion in the Oscars, which is spearheaded by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. “It would make a lot of sense, especially with how hard the stunt teams work ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/14/expert-verdict-tom-cruise-mission-impossible-stunts-amy-johnston", "domain": "theguardian.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 5744}, {"source_number": 2, "title": "DW 'Mission: Impossible': Tom Cruise and stunt-performing stars", "snippet": "July 13, 2023 - In 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol' (2011), Tom Cruise climbs up the world's tallest building · A highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump .", "full_content": "In \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning\" superstar Tom Cruise once again does his own stunts.

One of the aspects that makes the series so popular is that Tom Cruise performs many of the film stunts himself, without the aid of CGI or stunt doubles. That approach has turned him into an action megastar.\n\nDaring action scenes\n\nUnforgettable scenes in the previous movies include Tom Cruise climbing up the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, or hanging from a plane as it takes off.\n\nIn 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol' (2011), Tom Cruise climbs up the world's tallest building Image: David James/Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nA highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump.\n\nLike the \"John Wick\" films with Keanu Reeves, the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise counters the trend of having blockbuster action scenes created exclusively through CGI.\n\nCruise is perhaps the most famous action star doing his own stunts today. But other actors, including older ones, also insist on filming dangerous sequences themselves in order to make the movie feel more authentic.\n\nJackie Chan: Stunt legend despite serious accident\n\nThis includes Chinese martial arts legend Jackie Chan, who has insisted on doing practically all of his stunts himself since the 1970s.\n\nHis most notable performances are in \"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow\" (1978), \"Police Story\" and \"Police Story 2\" (1985 and 1988) and \"Armour of God\" (1986).\n\nDuring the filming of the latter, Chan almost died while filming a relatively simple stunt. Jumping from a ledge onto a tree, he fell and crashed onto a rock, breaking a few ribs and cracking his skull.\n\nJackie Chan in 'Amour of God,' 1986 Image: Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nMichelle Yeoh: Former 'Bond girl' and martial arts legend\n\nIn her Oscar-winning role in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" 60-year-old Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh portrays a laundromat owner who in an alternate universe is also a famous martial arts movie star — inspired by the actress' own career.\n\nMichelle Yeoh in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (2000), which will be re-released in theaters in 2023 Image: Columbia Films/Entertainment Pictures/ZUMAPRESS/picture alliance\n\nYeoh, who is also among the stars renowned for performing stunts herself, played alongside Jackie Chan in action classics like \"Police Story 3: Supercop\" or \"Supercop 2.\" She rose to international prominence with the 2000 martial arts film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" in which she also did her own stunts.\n\nKeanu Reeves: 'I do all of the action'\n\nCanadian actor Keanu Reeves doesn't shy away from getting his hands dirty in action-packed scenes either. In films like \"Speed\" (1994), \"Matrix\" (1999) or the \"John Wick\" series, he jumps out of moving cars and fights his opponents in nerve-wracking scenes.\n\nIn 'Chain Reaction' (1996), Reeves escapes an explosion on a motorcycle Image: TBM/United Archives/picture alliance\n\nFollowing the release of \"John Wick 3,\" Reeves confirmed in an interview that he did almost all of the stunt work himself: \"I do all of the action. I'm 90 percent of what's happening there. I'm maintaining the connection to the audience, and with the story.\"\n\nHarrison Ford: Stuntman at 80\n\n\"Indiana Jones\" star Harrison Ford can't be left out of any list of actors performing their own stunts.\n\nThe 80-year-old actor has had an impressive film career spanning six decades. His most successful films include the \"Star Wars\" saga and the \"Indiana Jones\" series.\n\nHarrison Ford shot this iconic opening scene from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' 10 times Image: Paramount/Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nThe opening scene of the first Indiana Jones movie,\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is particularly iconic, with Harrison Ford running away from a giant boulder that is chasing him. Even though the rock was a prop, it was still heavy enough to seriously injure the actor, who was not doubled in the scene.\n\nFord completely immersed himself in the role of daredevil archeologist Indiana Jones.\n\nIn the recently released \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" he still took over many stunts himself, dislocating his shoulder while filming.

The Mission: Impossible franchise has thus become synonymous with his name, and his breathtaking dedication to provide audiences with a spectacle worthy of going to the movie theatre.\n\nAnd the eighth and latest installment of the franchise, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning (2025) has truly raised the bar – Tom’s spectacular stunts for the film has just awarded the accomplished athlete with a Guinness World Records title for most burning parachute jumps by an individual.\n\nThe star leapt out of a helicopter 16 times while strapped to a parachute pre-soaked in fuel and lit ablaze, before cutting away the charred remnants of the first chute and safely deploying a backup. No other actor or stuntman has come close to that amount of death-defying drops, and his dedication was rewarded with the record title on 4 June.\n\n“Tom doesn't just play action heroes – he is an action hero!” said Craig Glenday, Editor-in-Chief of Guinness World Records. “A large part of his success can be chalked up to his absolute focus on authenticity and pushing the boundaries of what a leading man can do. It's an honour to be able to recognize his utter fearlessness with this new Guinness World Records title.”\n\nCruise and his crew are no strangers to these amazing aerial action shots, especially after Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018), when Tom became the first actor to ever complete a HALO drop (high altitude, low open) on camera. To replicate the feeling of a secret spy mission, the team used an actual military tactic of flying extremely high to 25,000 ft, then dropping Tom, who plummets downwards at 200 MPH to below 2,000 ft before deploying his parachute to sneak into a country without being detected.\n\n“The audience can tell when something’s been cheated, so it’s important to be doing it all for-real,” said Wade Eastwood, Second Unit Director / Stunt Coordinator for Fallout.\n\nYet despite the risk, Tom always leaps headfirst into his challenges – the star has been a licensed skydiver for many years, and he completed hundreds of jumps in preparation for his latest stunt.\n\nFilming for The Final Reckoning took place in Drakensberg, South Africa, and the team spent weeks planning and preparing a sequence where they would take Tom up in a helicopter to a minimum of 7,500 ft before dropping him while attached to a flaming parachute.\n\nThe parachute was pre-soaked in fuel and lit ablaze, and after his life-net incinerated, Tom would cut away the burning fabric and deploy a backup chute to break his landing. But when skydiving from a moving vehicle, time is of the essence – and the parachute could only burn for 2.5 to 3 seconds before completely disintegrating.\n\nWith so many moving pieces in play, Tom and the Mission: Impossible crew completed fiery 16 drops in the quest for the perfect action shot. And in some of these jumps, he even has a 50 lb snorri camera rig attached to his body to capture a close-up look of the exhilarating fall.\n\nThe result is a breathtaking scene of a spy – and a very famous face – spiraling into an Icarus-like descent before saving himself at the very last moment from the grips of fate and the cold hard ground.", "url": "https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2025/6/hollywood-legend-tom-cruise-becomes-record-holder-for-his-fiery-mission-impossible-stunt", "domain": "guinnessworldrecords.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3894}, {"source_number": 4, "title": "People Look Back at Tom Cruise's 16 Most Exhilarating 'Mission: Impossible' Stunts — Including Which Scared Him the Most", "snippet": "May 25, 2025 - In PEOPLE’s special issue on the franchise, Cruise explained why he continues doing his own stunts. “ People feel the authenticity .

Over the franchise's 30-year span, Cruise has done everything from dangling from a wire in Mission: Impossible to motorcycling off a cliff in Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nIn PEOPLE’s special issue on the franchise, Cruise explained why he continues doing his own stunts.\n\n“People feel the authenticity. You feel the dedication and joy in learning something and then creating. That is something that I tell artists all the time: Don’t ask permission to create,” he said. “If you’re interested in dancing and singing, do it. I will learn a skill, and I know eventually I’m going to use it in a movie.”\n\nHere's everything to know about Tom Cruise’s most exhilarating stunts in the Mission: Impossible franchise.\n\nMission: Impossible escape from exploding aquarium\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible' (1996). Murray Close/Getty\n\nIn 1996, Cruise's Hunt kicked off his franchise with one of its most iconic stunts to date.\n\nAfter being accused of being a mole, Hunt creates a distraction by using an exploding stick of gum to blow up an aquarium. He jumps through a glass window, with 16 gallons of water propelling him outwards.\n\nThe scene was so dangerous that co-producer Paula Wagner told PEOPLE that Cruise hurt his foot while shooting it.\n\nMission: Impossible wire dangling\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible' (1996). Murray Close/Getty\n\nIn the very first movie, Cruise's Hunt created another famous moment when he dangled from a cable attached to his vest while retrieving a list containing all the identities of the IMF’s secret agents. While doing so, Hunt couldn't touch the ground or set off heat sensors, making for a breathtaking stunt.\n\nCruise told PEOPLE that the scene was partially inspired by actual trapeze artists.\n\n“There were things I wanted to introduce into Mission: that cable and vest I had for the CIA scene? That’s a vest I’d seen going to Cirque du Soleil in the ‘80s,” he said.\n\nMission: Impossible train jump\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible' (1996). Alamy\n\nIn the original movie’s finale, Hunt attempts to confront the real mole Jim (Jon Voight) on top of a train. He does so by luring a helicopter into a tunnel, then jumping from the helicopter onto the train.\n\nTo make this happen, Cruise repeatedly swung across a stage, landing hard each time. But co-writer David Koepp told PEOPLE that Cruise was smiling between takes.\n\n“He’s incredibly persistent and focused, and he’ll drive you completely insane because he keeps coming at it and at it and at it,” Koepp said.\n\nMission: Impossible II cliff-climbing\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible II' (2000). © Globe Photos/ZUMAPRESS.com\n\nThe first sequel in the Mission: Impossible franchise began with a shocking scene in which Cruise free-climbs a 2,000-ft. rock face in Utah. Although Cruise was wearing a harness — which was edited out — the scene was still extremely dangerous, especially considering Cruise did it with an injured foot.\n\n“I’m climbing up the side of that thing, we had gale force winds, and Sherry [Lansing, then head of Paramount], who’s my dear friend, kept trying to have me come up with a different sequence instead of rock climbing, because it was so dangerous,” Cruise told PEOPLE.\n\nMission: Impossible II knife fight\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible II' (2000). Alamy\n\nIn Mission: Impossible II, Hunt fights with the film’s villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) on a beach, which leads to Ambrose attacking Hunt with a knife. The knife was attached to a cable and measured to be seemingly less than an inch away from Cruise’s eyeball.\n\nCruise told PEOPLE that this is the franchise’s most underrated stunt. “In M:I-2, with the knife going [so near] my eye, that’s a real knife, not a computer-generated image. How we figure out to get that knife that close to the eye, there’s technical things all of us accomplish together.”\n\nMission: Impossible III swinging and parachuting from skyscrapers\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible III' (2006). PARAMOUNT PICTURES / VAUGHAN, STEPHEN\n\nIn Mission: Impossible III, Hunt makes a daring escape after retrieving the coveted Rabbit's Foot.

Now, at 62, Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt for one final mission – and he’s still doing his own stunts.\n\nWith Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, the saga reaches its high-stakes finale. But behind the scenes of death-defying spectacles lies a fascinating question: just how far can the human body be pushed – and trained – to pull off the seemingly impossible?\n\nAnd at what cost? In filming the eight Mission: Impossible films, Cruise has suffered a broken ankle, cracked ribs and a torn shoulder.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to consider the capabilities – and limits – of the human body in being able to achieve these awesome heights. How much is it possible to train to achieve the apparently impossible?\n\nGet your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox.

Cruise wanted to film this all in one take and sought help from freediving instructors in order to hold his breath for the required time – over six minutes!\n\nThe average human can hold their breath for about 30 to 90 seconds. That’s without training. Although there’s an innate diving reflex built into the human body that allows it to temporarily adapt to immersion underwater.\n\nThe response is to lower the heart rate and redirect blood to the body’s core, essentially enabling it to lower its metabolic demand and preserve the function of the vital organs, like the brain and heart.\n\nAll well and good, but consider now the need to swim, as well as resist the pressure of the water pressing on the lungs. And also while fighting that desperate urge as a result of rising CO₂ to take a deep breath – which, underwater, would be catastrophic.\n\nAnd if the diver’s oxygen levels fall too low, they might black out and lose consciousness. That’s why shallow water drowning is a real risk here.\n\nThat’s where freediving training comes into play. With practice, there are several ways you can increase the time you’re able to remain underwater. These include mastering breathing techniques to retain the maximum amount of air in the lungs. Sustained practice might also lead to increased oxygen storage capacity in the bloodstream.\n\nThis process takes months to years to attain and might lengthen the immersion time, on average, to around five minutes. What Cruise managed to achieve was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nFree climbing – and that scene\n\nMission Impossible films often open with Ethan Hunt working his way up some impossibly sheer building or cliff face with the agility of a mountain goat. He appears to be free climbing without a harness, and at the start of Mission: Impossible 2, clinging on with just one hand. While Cruise used safety wires to secure himself, the climbing was 100% real.\n\nThen, of course, how could we forget that scene? The one in the original Mission: Impossible – where he has to suspend all limbs, centimetres from the ground, to prevent himself from setting off the alarms.\n\nAlthough Cruise hasn’t revealed his specific training regime for these stunts that I can see – performing any of these actions would require an exceptionally strong back and core.\n\nThe muscles of our backs keep the spine straight and upright. Some span the space between back and limb, such as latissimus dorsi, or “lats”. These sheets of muscle, prized by bodybuilders, are also particularly valuable to climbers – allowing you to perform a chin-up, or pull yourself up that rock face.\n\nBesides this, many other muscles are needed for extreme climbing – those that enable a strong grip, allow for reaching and “push offs”, and maintain tension and hold. It’s no wonder climbing is considered one of the best whole-body workouts.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Cruise is known to have trained extensively for this. To understand even an element of the difficulty he may have faced, you could try adopting that vault heist pose, with your belly in contact with the floor, and see how long you can hold it. I won’t tell you how pitiful my own attempt was.\n\nParamount Pictures/Alamy\n\nWhat a blast\n\nHunt has also escaped a fair few explosions in his time, from a helicopter in the Channel tunnel to a detonating fish tank in Prague. In Mission: Impossible 3, on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, another helicopter launching a missile triggers an explosion that sends Hunt smashing into a car. Again, Cruise did it all himself, for the price of two cracked ribs.\n\nPyrotechnics were used for the explosion, but of course, they couldn’t be used to lift Cruise up and deposit him against the car. The solution? A series of wires were used to drag him sideways.

Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nFrom climbing the world's tallest building to clinging to the wing of a plane in flight and even jumping on Oprah's couch — there's a reason why Tom Cruise is the last great action star.\n\nIt's simple: stunts.\n\nIn the 15 years since the release of 2011's \"Ghost Protocol,\" the fourth \"Mission: Impossible\" film, Cruise has done increasingly hair-raising stunts in each of his new movies.\n\nEarlier in his career, Cruise acted in a greater mix of genres, including the 1994 horror \"Interview with the Vampire,\" the 1996 comedy-drama \"Jerry Maguire,\" and the 1999 erotic thriller \"Eyes Wide Shut.\" In that era, he was considered widely a sex symbol.\n\nNow, he trades in extraordinary feats.\n\n\"I'm always pushing,\" Tom Cruise told Business Insider in 2023 on the red carpet for \"Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning.\"\n\n\"Every time they say, 'Can you top it? Can you not top it?' We're always pushing. Every film I do, whatever genre it's in, I want to make it as entertaining as possible for that audience. I know I can do things better,\" he said.\n\nAnd it's a winning tactic. \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in which Cruise flew in real fighter jets, raked in $1.5 billion in 2022, while \"Dead Reckoning,\" where he leapt off a mountain on a motorbike, made $567 million.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nIn \"Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning,\" which is out on Friday, Cruise performs two nerve-shredding stunts: a scuba dive into the wreck of a submarine that rolls down into an ocean trench, and the climactic third act, where his character clings on to a biplane in flight.\n\nIt's expected to make $80 million in its opening weekend, The Hollywood Reporter reported, citing the National Research Group.\n\nCruise's enduring star power can even grab the attention of the most seasoned industry insiders. Rob Mitchell, the director of theatrical insights at film tech company Gower St. Analytics, recalled working as a sales analyst at Paramount in 2011, when employees did a set visit to see Cruise climb the Burj Khalifa.\n\n\"Everyone was taking pictures inside the Burj Khalifa, with Tom Cruise outside waving in,\" he told BI.\n\nThese sorts of stunts signal to audiences that Cruise is a bona fide star who is hardworking and takes his craft seriously—all ingredients of a movie more likely to be worth their hard-earned cash.\n\nReferring to \"Mission: Impossible,\" Mitchell said: \"There comes a point where people aren't really going for the story as much as they are for the excitement and the thrills.\"\n\n\"In an era dominated by CGI superheroes, Cruise's staying power lies in the 'authenticity' of his performances,\" Stuart Joy, the course leader of film and TV at Solent University, UK, told BI. \"Like Christopher Nolan, he champions analogue filmmaking in a digital age. But while Nolan does so behind the camera through practical effects and large-format film, Cruise embodies it on screen through real stunts and real danger.\"\n\nCruise's dedication to filmmaking has taken him around the world. During an interview at the BFI in London in May, he said he would \"force\" studios to send him to different countries to learn how movies were made there.\n\nHe also said encourages younger stars to \"spend time in the editing room, produce a movie, study old movies, recognize what the composition is giving you, know what those lenses are, understand the lighting and how to use it for your benefit.\"\n\nLast year, Cruise's \"Top Gun: Maverick\" costar Glen Powell told GQ that he was sent to a theater in Los Angeles to watch a six-hour \"film-school\" movie that Cruise made just for his friends.\n\n\"[Cruise] is like: 'Do we all agree that this is what a camera is? This is the difference between a film camera and a digital camera…' The funniest part is on flying. It was like he put together this entire flight school. So he would literally go 'OK, this is what a plane is. Here's how things fly. Here's how air pressure works,'\" Powell said.\n\nCentering his career around stunts is a smart PR move\n\nAs well as being undeniably impressive, stunts help to keep past controversies out of the conversation, Joy said.\n\n\"Cruise's transition from character-driven roles to stunt-centered performances seems intentional, not just as a creative decision but as a deliberate attempt to recalibrate public perceptions of his star persona,\" he said.\n\n\"After the mid-2000s controversies (most infamously the Oprah's sofa moment and scrutiny of his ties to Scientology) Cruise has successfully redirected the audience's attention,\" Joy added, referring to the moment in 2005 when he jumped on Winfrey's sofa while talking about his love for his then-girlfriend, and now ex-wife, Katie Holmes.\n\n\"Rather than inviting emotional connection through vulnerability, he now earns our praise and admiration through the s", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-cruise-own-stunts-real-mission-impossible-scientology-career-relevant-2025-5", "domain": "businessinsider.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 5683}, {"source_number": 8, "title": "Deseret News Tom Cruise hangs from airplane in ‘Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning’ trailer.

The answer is inevitably: something difficult and dangerous.\n\nYears ago, when Cruise and McQuarrie were beginning to sketch out the plot of 2018’s Mission: Impossible—Fallout, Cruise proposed a helicopter chase: his character in the films, Ethan Hunt, pursuing a bad guy, played by Henry Cavill, while both of them were aloft. As a rule, in Mission: Impossible, stunts are real: meaning they are performed by the actual actors involved, at least when possible, and when they are being done by Tom Cruise, that means all the time. “He’s the only actor in the world who is actually going to do everything,” Fraser Taggart, the series’s director of photography, told me.\n\nIn the Mission: Impossible franchise alone, Cruise has climbed the shiny glass sides of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building; hung from the side of an A400 military transport plane as it took off; and ridden an actual motorcycle off the edge of an actual Norwegian cliff. He has a commercial pilot license. He is one of 36 people in history to be named an honorary US naval aviator. He can parachute and BASE jump and free dive. But one issue with this particular idea for Fallout was that Cruise, at the time, was not trained as a helicopter pilot. So Cruise and McQuarrie made inquiries, and they were told that at eight hours a day, seven days a week, it would take three months to get Cruise up to speed. Cruise asked: What about the other 16 hours in a day?

With each subsequent Ethan Hunt adventure, we get more stories (like this one, from the pages of GQ) about Tom Cruise doing something extremely risky in order to enthrall an audience, whether he's learning to hold his breath underwater for six minutes or scaling the exterior of the world's tallest building.\n\nIn the series' seventh installment, Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Hunt states to a character that their life “will always be more important to me than my own,” which feels like a declaration of Cruise’s guiding philosophy when it comes to stunt work. Recall Matt Damon's story about a dinner conversation he had with Cruise about a stunt in Ghost Protocol and the safety coordinator who deemed the stunt too dangerous for Cruise to execute; the punch line of that story is Cruise telling Damon “So, I get a new safety guy.”\n\nCruise fulfills his mission statement in the latest and purportedly final Mission: Impossible film, Mission: Impossible — Final Reckoning, by first hanging off the wing of a biplane and then jumping from it to another, nearby plane—establishing a new benchmark for both blockbuster-film stunt performance and actorly self-endangerment.

It’s also worth noting that the age cut-off for kids with this policy is under 18.", "full_content": "Going to Disney World back in 1971 when it opened was a family affair in most cases. In fact, people dressed up for the occasion. Since then, a lot has changed around Disney culture, including the ride of Disney Adults. However, now there is a big revolt against Disney Adults from inside the Disney company. Disney World is implementing a one child policy, requiring all guests to have a kid with them in the parks.\n\nNew Disney World one child policy\n\nLong gone are the days when Disney is a family-focused place. In fact, it’s getting so unfriendly to the family that they are implementing a dress code that bans shorts and skirts as we reported here. Also, inside the parks, if you look around, you see far more adults without children. Now, Disney is revolting against Disney Adults with the one child policy.\n\nDisney Adults Taking over Disney World\n\nDisney Adults are adults who visit Disney World and Disneyland typically without kids. They have an obsession with Disney and take solo trips and trips with friends and family, but no kids. While no one truly understands the Disney Adult mindset, scientists who have studied these creatures boil their obsession down to two potential things. Nostalgia and/or longing for experience. Most Disney adults visit the parks on their own because it’s a sense of nostalgia as a child. However, others do it because they want to make memories from experience.\n\nDisney adults are taking over the parks, leading to one child policy\n\nBecause of this, there has been a 500% increase in hate towards Disney Adults in the past four years. Leading the charge are parents who want to bring their kids to Disney World and make magical memories for their family that will be remembered for years. Remember the first time your kids met Mickey Mouse or saw the Magic Kingdom opening show? It’s those magical moments that are getting lost due to the overwhelming increase in Disney Adults taking over the parks.\n\nDisney trips have gone from a vacation of making memories to an overcrowded and exhausting experience. From waking up at 6 AM to waiting 120 minutes for a ride, the experience isn’t what it used to be. The reason can only be boiled down to one thing. Disney Adults spend all of their money on trips there, taking away from the families with kids that want to enjoy the parks. Disney isn’t what it used to be, thanks to people who hate kids.\n\nWhat is the Disney World One Child Policy?\n\nThe Disney World One Child Policy is a controversial new park rule. Guests entering any of the Disney World parks will be required to have at least one child with them to enter. Guests without a child will not be allowed to enter the parks. This is a way for Disney to encourage more families to visit the parks and get away from adults without kids filling up the parks. It’s also worth noting that the age cut-off for kids with this policy is under 18. This is different from the age for tickets, in which guests over 14 are considered adults by Disney.\n\nYou now must have a kid to visit Disney World. Photo via Casey.callihan20 on TikTok\n\nWhy is Disney adding the one child policy? This seems like a way to lose money for Disney. They know Disney Adults keep coming back and spending money, so why would they do this? Disney believes the family is their core consumer. If they have a greater appeal to them, there is a larger upside than with Disney Adults. They want to essentially exterminate all Disney Adults and focus on the family unit again.\n\nThis One Child Policy certainly makes things like Disney Drag Day more controversial, since Disney is focusing on the family, then cramming drag culture into their parks. However, Disney’s decision to implement a one child policy is controversial. Many people (all Disney Adults) are furious that they need a child with them. Many even stopped to ask if a dog counts as a child. Despite this, Disney is going forth with requiring all adults at Disney World to have at least one child with them to enter.\n\nWhat do you think of the Disney World One Child Policy?

While it’s certainly not the majority that holds to this sentiment, it’s enough of the population that it’s been the subject of social media posts, opinion pieces on Disney fan sites, and even wild, expletive-laden debates, both online and in-person.\n\nRELATED: Disney Adults & Mental Health: What’s the Connection?\n\nSome people are simply hell-bent on the ideology that tells them that having children is a mandatory pre-requisite for visiting the parks, whether for the day or for a two-week vacation.

And to many self-proclaimed Disney adults, such a prospect was not only seen as an exciting and magical addition to the Disney family of offerings, but also as a show of support for Disney adults around the world.\n\nDisney Seemingly Changes Its Narrative\n\nBut just months after exciting announcements about Disney opening an interest list for potential res", "url": "https://www.disneydining.com/magic-kingdom-for-adults-with-children-only-bb1/", "domain": "disneydining.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 6782}, {"source_number": 4, "title": "Guest Says Adults Who Visit Disney Without Kids... : Disney Fanatic", "snippet": "Some Disney fans believe that adults without children are to blame for the declining magic of the parks .Some of these Disney adults do not have children , but that does not stop them from visiting the theme parks on a regular basis.", "full_content": "Some Disney fans believe that adults without children are to blame for the declining magic of the parks.\n\n“To all who come to this happy place, welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future.”\n\nWhen people think about planning a vacation, a lot of them think of a trip to a Disney Resort. Disney is one of the most popular vacation destinations in the world. Disney has theme parks all around the globe — Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, Disneyland Resort in California, Tokyo Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhile a lot of people may think that Disney is for kids, more and more people are realizing that it is a magical place, no matter how old you are.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of ire is being directed at a certain group of people — Disney adults. Disney adults are people who love visiting the Parks, wearing Disney clothes, buying Disney merchandise, and spending a lot of time streaming Disney+.\n\nSome of these Disney adults do not have children, but that does not stop them from visiting the theme parks on a regular basis. However, some people think that these childless adults should not only stop visiting, but they are actually ruining the Parks for everyone else.\n\nRedditor u/turlockmike took to the platform to say that adults who visit Disney are making the Parks miserable for everyone else. They are causing the Parks to become too expensive and are making the attraction lines too long.\n\nWhen I was a kid growing up in the 90s, my parents took us to disney world, it was a lot of fun, we got to ride all the rides we wanted, see everything, stay at a disney hotel and it was affordable for our modest income. 2 years ago, we took our kids. I make twice as much as my dad did back then and the disney hotels were insanely priced, couldn’t afford it. We still got a nice place to stay though, but outside of the parks. But when we went to the parks, it was basically all adults everywhere. The rides that were for the youngest kids were basically empty, but any ride that appealed to adults had insanely long lines, like 3 hours or more. We didn’t get to ride any of the cool new rides other than the few we could get a fastpass (or genie pass, not sure what it’s called). Disney world and disney land are for kids. Anyone over 21 visiting that isn’t on their honeymoon or with their kids is making the place miserable. There are way more fun things to do, go do those and leave disney alone. Edit; If you never got to go to disney world as a kid, fine, no one has an issue with first time visitors. That’s not the issue.\n\nThe Reddit user’s opinion definitely divided other users. Some agreed that if the “extra” adults weren’t going to the parks, the prices would be cheaper. The “extra” adults are causing an increase in demand and a decrease in supply.\n\nHowever, others pointed out that Disney is targeting more adults — especially with the amount of alcohol currently being sold in the parks.\n\nDrinking around the world is very popular with guests who visit EPCOT in Walt Disney World. Disney California Adventure Park in Disneyland also hosts Food & Wine Festivals and is known for its specialty drinks.\n\nDisney is also making a lot more content targeting an older audience in an attempt to get them to sign up for or remain a subscriber on Disney+.\n\nOthers made the valid point that it is the adults who actually pay for everything at Disney. Disney doesn’t care if those adults have children or if they are by themselves.\n\nWhat matters is that the adults have money that they are willing to spend in the parks. It was also pointed out that Disney is for everyone, since a company is “for profit.”\n\nAnd let’s not forget, when Walt Disney opened the gates of Disneyland Park, he welcomed everyone.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and may not reflect the views of Disney Fanatic as a whole.", "url": "https://www.disneyfanatic.com/guest-says-adults-who-visit-disney-without-kids-ruining-parks-disney-adults-ks1/", "domain": "disneyfanatic.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3982}, {"source_number": 5, "title": "Guide to Going to Disney World for Adults Without Kids", "snippet": "Disney World for Adults … Without Kids?

Of course, it’s all up to you and the type of trip and budget you have in mind.\n\nBut, for most adults staying at a Disney World Deluxe resort is a pretty special experience. Deluxe resorts include large hotel rooms, multiple restaurants to dine at, on-site recreation (like water activities, spa services, and arcades), shopping, and are typically closer to Disney theme parks. If you’re looking for a relaxing or even just convenient experience, you can’t get better than a Deluxe resort.\n\nBelow, check out a video of a couple that enjoyed their time at WDW without their children.\n\nHere are a list of Deluxe Resorts on Disney property that are extremely popular for adults of all ages.\n\nAnimal Kingdom Lodge:\n\nEver dreamed of taking a trip to the African savanna? The Animal Kingdom Lodge will make you feel like you’re on a real safari. The lodge itself offers incredible views of African wildlife, including giraffes and zebras.

Animal Kingdom Lodge offers some of the best dining experiences on property, including Jiko: The Cooking Place, spa services (including massage), several pools, lounges, and shopping. It’s a popular resort choice for adults of all ages.\n\nBoardwalk Resort:\n\nRelive the 1920s, when you stay at the Boardwalk Resort. If you are planning to spend a lot of time at Epcot, Boardwalk is the perfect resort, because it’s a short walk to the Epcot World Showcase.

After years of online bullying about overemotional reactions during character meet & greets and Disney Park proposals, some Disney Parks Guests want them banned from Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort altogether.\n\nIn a post on the “True Unpopular Opinion” subreddit, u/turlockmike shared their experience taking their kids to Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Disney’s Hollywood Studios, and Disney’s Animal Kingdom for the first time since their own childhood family vacation.\n\n“Adults who visit Disney World without kids are ruining it,” the Guest argued. “When I was a kid growing up in the 90s, my parents took us to disney world, it was a lot of fun, we got to ride all the rides we wanted, see everything, stay at a disney hotel and it was affordable for our modest income. 2 years ago, we took our kids. I make twice as much as my dad did back then and the disney hotels were insanely priced, couldn’t afford it.”\n\nThe family got a nice place to stay off-property, but were miserable at the Disney Parks.\n\n“It was basically all adults everywhere,” they recalled. “The rides that were for the youngest kids were basically empty, but any ride that appealed to adults had insanely long lines, like 3 hours or more. We didn’t get to ride any of the cool new rides other than the few we could get a fastpass (or genie pass, not sure what it’s called).”\n\n“Disney world and disney land are for kids,” the Guest concluded. “Anyone over 21 visiting that isn’t on their honeymoon or with their kids is making the place miserable. There are way more fun things to do, go do those and leave Disney alone.”\n\nWhile a few dozen upvoted the Guest’s post in agreement, most fired back.\n\n“Disney World is actually for anyone who can afford a ticket, which 99% of the time, is adults,” u/mczmczmcz said. “No amusement park could exist if it were literally for children.”\n\n“Fun fact: a lot of us didn’t have parents who could afford Disney World as kids so people that go as adults are just making up for lost time,” u/TheSnappleGhost agreed.\n\n“Imagine being so entitled that you think having kids gives you the right to dictate where other people go on vacation,” u/PWcrash wrote. “All because you don’t want to deal with impatient kids waiting in long lines at surprise surprise…DISNEY! I would LOVE if there were more adults only spaces or at least spaces that don’t allow kids under the age of 6 but we all can’t get what we want.”\n\nAre Disney Adults the problem at Walt Disney World Resort?

Many have been mocked for interacting with characters, tearing up at Cinderella Castle, and getting engaged at Disney Parks.

She blamed childless Disney Adults in line for taking up space that should belong to her child and making him wait.\n\n“It pisses me off when I see childless couples at Disney World,” she said. “People without children should be banned from entering.”\n\nThe Guest also wrote that childless Disney Adults “have no idea what it’s like to be a mother.”\n\n“They don’t know anything about the exertion of a visit to the amusement Park or they don’t know the bad conscience when you don’t fulfill every wish of your child,” Ka-Insider wrote. “On the contrary: as soon as a child cries, one would always see the mother as a bad mother.”\n\nSome Disney Adults have called for similar bans on children at the Disney Parks – at least on certain days or special events. Neither is likely to happen: Walt Disney designed his Theme Parks to entertain children and adults alike.\n\nShould childless Disney Adults be banned from the Parks?

The examples are Legoland outside of Boston, which we have discussed previously, as well as a local kiddie farm (not that they raise kiddies, they raise pettable animals) and the ubiquitous Chuck E. Cheese.\n\nWhat dismays me about the ban on child-free adults is how grateful some parents seem to be, even though, a generation ago, I really don’t think there even WERE such bans. So the bans are actually serving to DE-NORMALIZE the idea of kids around adults. Reporter Michael Hartwell interviewed a lot of parents for his piece (including me), and not all are in favor of the ban. But this one is:\n\nBarbara Maciel Lando, a mother of two from Leominster, likes policies like the one at Davis Farmland. “Adults without children are never a good sign in a children’s play land area. It makes an easy target for someone to snatch a child and run,” said Lando, 45. She said child predators are a serious risk today. “You nor I wouldn’t know if there was a registered offender or a drug trafficker where children are,” she said. “You never know. You cannot trust anyone these days. Even a priest can’t be trusted.” Others disagree.\n\nYou can guess who’s one of the others. And I especially disagree with the general manager of the Legoland in Sommerville, MA, who explains the ban this way:\n\n“It’s really about an experience. We’re looking to create a safe, fun environment for families and kids,” said Gilmore. “We don’t apologize for it at all.”\n\nNo apologies for suggesting that if a child is in the same museum as an adult without a child, the child is automatically in danger? Does he think generations of children have been UNsafe at the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, pretty much every other museum on the planet? Does he think there are rooms in his museum where kids could be carted off, unnoticed by all? Really, what DOES he think? Rapes in the bathroom? Kidnappings? Murder? It’s another one of those cases where a vague “something could happen!” allows parents to fill in the blank and suddenly we are all terrified of a 20-year-old Lego fan standing next to our 5 year old.\n\nThese bans are not good for kids because they are not good for our perception of the world.

Each hotel has different Disney details and theming and one of the benefits includes gaining early entry into one of the parks each day, along with a dedicated entrance to Disney California Adventure Park.Make a dining reservation for brunch at Lamplight Lounge , and enjoy some specialty beverages.

Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future.”\n\nWhen people think about planning a vacation, a lot of them think of a trip to a Disney Resort. Disney is one of the most popular vacation destinations in the world. Disney has theme parks all around the globe — Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, Disneyland Resort in California, Tokyo Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhile a lot of people may think that Disney is for kids, more and more people are realizing that it is a magical place, no matter how old you are.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of ire is being directed at a certain group of people — Disney adults. Disney adults are people who love visiting the Parks, wearing Disney clothes, buying Disney merchandise, and spending a lot of time streaming Disney+.\n\nSome of these Disney adults do not have children, but that does not stop them from visiting the theme parks on a regular basis. However, some people think that these childless adults should not only stop visiting, but they are actually ruining the Parks for everyone else.\n\nRedditor u/turlockmike took to the platform to say that adults who visit Disney are making the Parks miserable for everyone else. They are causing the Parks to become too expensive and are making the attraction lines too long.\n\nWhen I was a kid growing up in the 90s, my parents took us to disney world, it was a lot of fun, we got to ride all the rides we wanted, see everything, stay at a disney hotel and it was affordable for our modest income. 2 years ago, we took our kids. I make twice as much as my dad did back then and the disney hotels were insanely priced, couldn’t afford it. We still got a nice place to stay though, but outside of the parks. But when we went to the parks, it was basically all adults everywhere. The rides that were for the youngest kids were basically empty, but any ride that appealed to adults had insanely long lines, like 3 hours or more. We didn’t get to ride any of the cool new rides other than the few we could get a fastpass (or genie pass, not sure what it’s called). Disney world and disney land are for kids. Anyone over 21 visiting that isn’t on their honeymoon or with their kids is making the place miserable. There are way more fun things to do, go do those and leave disney alone. Edit; If you never got to go to disney world as a kid, fine, no one has an issue with first time visitors. That’s not the issue.\n\nThe Reddit user’s opinion definitely divided other users. Some agreed that if the “extra” adults weren’t going to the parks, the prices would be cheaper. The “extra” adults are causing an increase in demand and a decrease in supply.\n\nHowever, others pointed out that Disney is targeting more adults — especially with the amount of alcohol currently being sold in the parks.\n\nDrinking around the world is very popular with guests who visit EPCOT in Walt Disney World. Disney California Adventure Park in Disneyland also hosts Food & Wine Festivals and is known for its specialty drinks.\n\nDisney is also making a lot more content targeting an older audience in an attempt to get them to sign up for or remain a subscriber on Disney+.\n\nOthers made the valid point that it is the adults who actually pay for everything at Disney. Disney doesn’t care if those adults have children or if they are by themselves.\n\nWhat matters is that the adults have money that they are willing to spend in the parks. It was also pointed out that Disney is for everyone, since a company is “for profit.”\n\nAnd let’s not forget, when Walt Disney opened the gates of Disneyland Park, he welcomed everyone.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and may not reflect the views of Disney Fanatic as a whole.", "url": "https://www.disneyfanatic.com/guest-says-adults-who-visit-disney-without-kids-ruining-parks-disney-adults-ks1/", "domain": "disneyfanatic.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3982}, {"source_number": 2, "title": "Guide to Going to Disney World for Adults Without Kids", "snippet": "Disney World for Adults … Without Kids?

But, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Disney World is one of the best vacation destinations for anyone — even if they don’t have kids coming with them on the trip.\n\nFrom world class dining experiences, thrill rides, shopping, and more, Disney offers a lot for anyone traveling without children. So, what are the best ways to enjoy Disney World without kids? Well, in this article, we’re going to specifically address this question by naming some fun activities and attractions you do union immediately entering the park.\n\nDisney World for Adults…Without Kids?\n\nThe Disney Parks and Resorts offers a lot of variety when it comes to hotel accommodations. Disney has three tiers of resorts — Value, Moderate, and Deluxe. Each of these offers a variety of amenities, like dining, shopping, and spa services.\n\nBut, which ones are the best Disney World hotels for adults? Of course, it’s all up to you and the type of trip and budget you have in mind.\n\nBut, for most adults staying at a Disney World Deluxe resort is a pretty special experience. Deluxe resorts include large hotel rooms, multiple restaurants to dine at, on-site recreation (like water activities, spa services, and arcades), shopping, and are typically closer to Disney theme parks. If you’re looking for a relaxing or even just convenient experience, you can’t get better than a Deluxe resort.\n\nBelow, check out a video of a couple that enjoyed their time at WDW without their children.\n\nHere are a list of Deluxe Resorts on Disney property that are extremely popular for adults of all ages.\n\nAnimal Kingdom Lodge:\n\nEver dreamed of taking a trip to the African savanna? The Animal Kingdom Lodge will make you feel like you’re on a real safari. The lodge itself offers incredible views of African wildlife, including giraffes and zebras. And, depending on the view that you choose for your hotel room, you may even have views of these amazing animals right outside your hotel balcony.\n\nHow cool is that? Animal Kingdom Lodge offers some of the best dining experiences on property, including Jiko: The Cooking Place, spa services (including massage), several pools, lounges, and shopping. It’s a popular resort choice for adults of all ages.\n\nBoardwalk Resort:\n\nRelive the 1920s, when you stay at the Boardwalk Resort. If you are planning to spend a lot of time at Epcot, Boardwalk is the perfect resort, because it’s a short walk to the Epcot World Showcase. If you love fine dining, you’ll have a lot of options at the Boardwalk because there are many restaurants at the resort and located nearby at the theme parks and Disney’s Yacht & Beach Club and Swan and Dolphin Resorts.\n\nThe Boardwalk Resort has access to nighttime entertainment like Jellyrolls Dueling Piano Bar too. Boardwalk Resort is great for adults of all ages but is particularly good for younger adults and younger couples.\n\nContemporary Resort:\n\nTake a trip into the future with Disney’s Contemporary Resort. The Contemporary is an iconic Disney World resort and one of the first ones built too. So, it has a lot of Disney history. Most impressive are the views and features. Disney’s monorails go directly through the resort, making it a unique place to stay and explore.\n\nIf you love fine dining, Disney’s Contemporary Resort has one of the best fine dining experiences on Disney property — the California Grill. This signature dining restaurant is located on the top floor of the resort and includes some of the best views you will find of the Disney Parks and Resorts.\n\nThe Contemporary also has access to basic spa services, water activities, a pool, and several dining experiences. Plus, it’s a short walk or monorail ride to the Magic Kingdom. This resort is popular with couples and older adults.\n\nGrand Floridian Resort & Spa:\n\nWhen it comes to a truly luxurious Disney resort experience, it can’t get any more grand than Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. If you love fine dining, there is not one but three signature dining restaurants located here, including Victoria & Albert’s — a AAA 5-Diamond Award winning restaurant.\n\nGuests who visit the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa can also take advantage of a full luxury spa experience, pools, water activities, shopping, and more. This resort is very popular for older couples and those adults who want to experience a luxurious vacation.\n\n\n\nPolynesian Village Resort:\n\nSay “Aloha” to Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort. If you have always wanted to go to Hawaii, the Polynesian Resort is for you. Fun and filled with lots of amenities, you can’t go wrong with this deluxe resort. The resort offers several dining experiences, including the Spirit of Aloha dinner show.\n\nPlus, there are lots of water activities, a volcano themed pool, a popular bar — Trader Sam’s Grog Grotto, and you can even learn to make Hawaiian leis or hula dance.

The examples are Legoland outside of Boston, which we have discussed previously, as well as a local kiddie farm (not that they raise kiddies, they raise pettable animals) and the ubiquitous Chuck E. Cheese.\n\nWhat dismays me about the ban on child-free adults is how grateful some parents seem to be, even though, a generation ago, I really don’t think there even WERE such bans. So the bans are actually serving to DE-NORMALIZE the idea of kids around adults. Reporter Michael Hartwell interviewed a lot of parents for his piece (including me), and not all are in favor of the ban. But this one is:\n\nBarbara Maciel Lando, a mother of two from Leominster, likes policies like the one at Davis Farmland. “Adults without children are never a good sign in a children’s play land area. It makes an easy target for someone to snatch a child and run,” said Lando, 45. She said child predators are a serious risk today. “You nor I wouldn’t know if there was a registered offender or a drug trafficker where children are,” she said. “You never know. You cannot trust anyone these days. Even a priest can’t be trusted.” Others disagree.\n\nYou can guess who’s one of the others. And I especially disagree with the general manager of the Legoland in Sommerville, MA, who explains the ban this way:\n\n“It’s really about an experience. We’re looking to create a safe, fun environment for families and kids,” said Gilmore. “We don’t apologize for it at all.”\n\nNo apologies for suggesting that if a child is in the same museum as an adult without a child, the child is automatically in danger? Does he think generations of children have been UNsafe at the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, pretty much every other museum on the planet? Does he think there are rooms in his museum where kids could be carted off, unnoticed by all? Really, what DOES he think? Rapes in the bathroom? Kidnappings? Murder? It’s another one of those cases where a vague “something could happen!” allows parents to fill in the blank and suddenly we are all terrified of a 20-year-old Lego fan standing next to our 5 year old.\n\nThese bans are not good for kids because they are not good for our perception of the world. Plus, sometimes a middle aged woman whose kids are off on their own just likes to hang with a llama.

There’s plenty of adult fun to be had, from the Disneyland Resort Hotels to the Downtown Disney District , and of course in both parks.A visit to Disneyland Resort is complete when you wake up in the magic. I recommend getting a room at one of the three hotels on the property - Disneyland Hotel (including the Villas at Disneyland Hotel), Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa , and Pixar Place Hotel . Each hotel has different Disney details and theming and one of the benefits includes gaining early entry into one of the parks each day, along with a dedicated entrance to Disney California Adventure Park.Make a dining reservation for brunch at Lamplight Lounge , and enjoy some specialty beverages. Purchase a park hopper ticket and take advantage of Lightning Lane Multi Pass to maximize your attraction experiences. If you want a relaxing experience after the parks, book a spa treatment at Tenaya Stone Spa . It’s the perfect way to end your day with a massage or spa pedicure. There are many specialty products to purchase, too!Whatever you end up doing, Carley, remember it's who you’re with that makes it extra magical.

Do you find it creepy that me and my girlfriend or me with a group of friends visit these parks to experience the rides? If so then I'd say that you need to broaden your mind a little.It's not necessarily about chasing credits, I like the look of a few of Gullivers' rides in particular the Antelope yet I can't experience these rides. The irony of course is that if I went with my girlfriend and we brought some random child this would be allowed but if we turned up minus the child we'd be turned away, how is that fair?You may be someone who's happy to just repeatedly visit the same parks (Thorpe and Alton) but I would grow very bored of this very quickly.

Jump to: Avengers: Doomsday release date – when can we expect Avengers 5? Avengers: Doomsday cast – who is joining Robert Downey Jr in Avengers 5? Avengers: Doomsday plot – what will Avengers 5 be about? Avengers: Doomsday trailer – any Avengers 5 footage yet? Avengers: Doomsday might have been delayed until December 2026 , but we have now at least had our first look at Doctor Doom in the MCU . The mid-credit scene of The Fantastic Four: First Steps marks Doctor Doom's MCU debut, although we only see him from behind. Avengers: Doomsday started filming in late April after its unique cast announcement that featured a lot of chairs, including some exciting X-Men additions and major omissions . During Marvel's Comic-Con panel in July 2024, it was confirmed that Joe and Anthony Russo were back to direct Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars . What's more, Robert Downey Jr is back, but not as Iron Man... as Doctor Doom. The Russos are taking over from original director Destin Daniel Cretton, who left the movie in November 2023. Stephen McFeely has written the script, taking over from Jeff Loveness, but Michael Waldron is also helping on Doomsday 's script. The pair will also be writing Avengers: Secret Wars . The next Avengers movie is half of a double bill that will bring The Multiverse Saga to a close , but before we can even start thinking of Secret Wars , there's a lot that needs to be done with Avengers: Doomsday . Here's everything you need to know about Avengers : Doomsday . Alberto E. Rodriguez // Getty Images Sign up to Disney+ Avengers: Doomsday release date – when can we expect Avengers 5? As mentioned above, Avengers: Doomsday has been hit by another release date delay and will now land in cinemas on 18 December 2026 . That's a seven-month delay from the previous release date of 1 May 2026, which itself was a year delay from the original 2 May 2025 release . The delay has also impacted Avengers: Secret Wars which will now land in cinemas on 17 December 2027 instead of 7 May 2027. Filming has at least now started on Avengers: Doomsday and like the Infinity War / Endgame double-bill, filming is planned to start on Avengers: Secret Wars pretty soon after Doomsday wraps. \"We're shooting them fairly back-to-back, it's a lot of work again, we may or may not survive, we'll see,\" Joe Russo confirmed in March 2025 . Marvel Studios Avengers: Doomsday cast – who is joining Robert Downey Jr in Avengers 5? Let's start with the massive news. Robert Downey Jr has been confirmed to play iconic Marvel villain Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday . We don't know exactly how it'll work yet, but it wouldn't be a surprise if this Doctor Doom comes from whatever world the upcoming Fantastic Four movie takes place in. It remains to be seen if Victor Von Doom is a Tony Stark variant. Jesse Grant // Getty Images We had to wait until March 2025 for further official cast additions, but we now know thanks to a bunch of chairs that the following MCU stars are coming back for Avengers: Doomsday : • Chris Hemsworth (Thor) • Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman) • Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America) • Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes) • Letitia Wright (Shuri/Black Panther) • Paul Rudd (Scott Lang/Ant-Man) • Wyatt Russell (John Walker/US Agent) • Tenoch Huerta Mejía (Namor) • Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) • Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) • Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova) Marvel Studios • Kelsey Grammer (Hank McCoy/Beast) • Lewis Pullman (Robert 'Bob' Reynolds/Sentry) • Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres/Falcon) • Joseph Quinn (Johnny Storm/Human Torch) • David Harbour (Red Guardian) • Winston Duke (M'Baku) • Hannah John-Kamen (Ava Starr/Ghost) • Tom Hiddleston (Loki) • Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier/Professor X) • Ian McKellen (Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto) • Alan Cumming (Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler) • Rebecca Romijn (Raven Darkhölme/Mystique) • James Marden (Scott Summers/Cyclops) • Channing Tatum (Remy LeBeau/Gambit) • Pedro Pascal (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic) The presence of the Thunderbolts* and The Fantastic Four casts aren't a surprise, given Feige confirmed they'd be in the Avengers movies at Comic-Con 2024 , but the OG X-Men returns are the ones to get fans most excited. We're still missing some major names that were widely expected to be in Avengers: Doomsday , such as Tom Holland's Spider-Man . However, Downey Jr teased future cast announcements to come in March 2025, but nobody else has been announced yet. Sony Pictures // Marvel Studios Who could those additional stars be? It's unclear at this point, but plenty of MCU stars have been having their say on potential returns.

We break down everything we know about every Marvel movie and TV show currently in the works. by Erik Amaya | May 22, 2025 | Comments TAGGED AS: Marvel , MCU , movies , streaming , TV [Updated August 1, 2025] The story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel Studios itself has been a tumultuous one since the release of Avengers: Endgame . The Phase Four films and television shows left audiences wondering if there was a new saga at all . The need to generate material for Disney+ also left many feeling the studio was unfocused and overextended, something studio president Kevin Feige would partially admit in 2025. Nevertheless, at SDCC 2022, he tried to quell some of these misgivings by revealing the full calendar for Phases Five and Six, labeling the whole thing as “The Multiverse Saga.” But almost as soon as the Multiverse calendar was made public, alterations were made. Movies shifted release dates and production schedules. Two industry strikes forced all television and movie production to grind to halt. Disney itself changed its priorities and instructed Marvel to slow its pipeline. The expected big bad of the new saga, Kang the Conqueror, proved unimpressive in his true debut appearance — Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — while the actor who portrayed him faced criminal charges in New York. He was ultimately let go from his Marvel contract, but it was unclear if Kang would carry on or be completely replaced with a difference character. And it just so happened that Doctor Doom seemed to be the logical replacement and Robert Downey Jr. was available… It all reveals that, despite the planning involved, Marvel Studios is malleable and ready to alter those plans if need be. Meanwhile, back in the MCU, heroes must rise, ne’er-do-wells must do what they do, and Marvel’s First Family must finally take its moment in the spotlight. And, as we have for the last few years, we’re keeping track of it all in this comprehensive guide of every upcoming Marvel Studios film (and television show) with a handy calendar of the studio’s projects through 2027 (and beyond). As always, we will continue to update this page frequently as new details emerge. And be careful: There are spoilers ahead. (Want to see what the other camp is up to? Check out our full breakdown of upcoming DC Studios movies .) WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT In Phase Six And beyond The SDCC 2024 presentation was full of bombast — from a Deadpool choir singing “Like A Prayer” to the Downey as Doom reveal — but was surprisingly short on words like “phase”, “Multiverse”, and “saga.” Consequently, it is unclear if that system of notation is still in place. What you can expect in lieu of phases is the end of the current saga in two upcoming Avengers films and the return of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in his fourth MCU outing. Also, there are a few TV shows readying for release that may still matter to the ongoing threads of Marvel storytelling… Although it remains unclear if phases remain part of the studio’s reported seven year calendar, we’re holding onto the nomenclature for all the projects set for release after First Steps until Feige offers an update on this aspect of the Marvel Method. Eyes of Wakanda (animated series) Premiere Date: August 6, 2025 What We Know: The anthology miniseries focuses on different protectors of Wakanda throughout its history. A clip shown at the 2024 D23 Marvel Animation presentation revealed a female Black Panther protecting her nation’s vibranium resources during the Age of Piracy, for example. Former Marvel storyboard artist Todd Harris serves as the series director and creator while Black Panther director Ryan Coogler serves as an executive producer. In July 2025, Disney released the first trailer for the series. How It Fits in the MCU: Unlike the other animated programs, Eyes of Wakanda details the history of Wakanda within the MCU. Of course, despite the presence of Coogler as an executive producer, we imagine he reserves the right to contradict anything revealed here in a subsequent Wakanda-set project (more on that below). The series will also establish the presence of an Iron Fist in the MCU, although it is unclear if this will undo the one featured in the Netflix Iron Fist series. Marvel Zombies (animated series) Premiere Date: October 2025 What We Know: Spinning off from a season 1 What If…? episode, various Marvel characters attempt to survive a zombie apocalypse. During the D23 Marvel Animation presentation mentioned above, the audience saw an extended clip establishing the fall of San Francisco and, five years later, Shang-Chi, Katy, and Jimmy Woo driving a zombie-infested version of the Fury Road. While it is unclear if the live action actors reprise their roles here, Iman Vellani is set to voice Kamala Khan, who is said to be central to the miniseries. Other characters trying to survive include Kate Bishop, Yelena Belova, and Blade(!).

While concrete story details are limited so far, the Russo Brothers' return to the MCU with Avengers: Doomsday promises to be a crossover event of unprecedented magnitude, with potentially hundreds of extremely powerful villains facing off against the biggest hero line-up ever united in the MCU timeline within one project. There can be no doubt that blood will be spilled. However, complications for Avengers: Doomsday arose based on Jonathan Majors' legal matters , as Majors was found guilty on two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault on December 18, 2023. Shortly after, reports came in that the MCU had cut ties with the actor going forward, and that Avengers: The Kang Dynasty would henceforth be Avengers 5 for the time being, with its new title of Avengers: Doomsday being announced months later. Avengers: Doomsday Latest News Marvel Studios Announces The Cast Of Doomsday Marvel Studios has officially announced the cast of Avengers: Doomsday and, like everyone thought, it features a massive list of characters, with a number of pleasant surprises thrown in for good measure. Included in the frankly absurdly large cast are various members of The Fantastic Four, Thunderbolts, Avengers, and even Fox's original X-Men characters . Of course, other major MCU characters that are typically not associated with a team will be in the film as well. Some of those names announced include Shang-Chi, Shuri, Loki, Thor, and more. Avengers: Doomsday was always thought to be a significant number of characters, but some of the ones announced were incredibly surprising, as it felt like Avengers: Secret Wars would be the one to really bring together characters from the entirety of Marvel's cinematic history. Doctor Doom is going to have his hands full. Avengers: Doomsday Release Date Getting Closer Every Year Doctor Doom descends from the sky wielding a sword, lighting cracking in the background. While it was originally set for release on May 2, 2025, Marvel shifted the Avengers: Doomsday release date to May 1, 2026 . Based on the story focusing on that of iconic Fantastic Four nemesis Doctor Doom, it seems the film will follow on directly from The Fantastic Four 's debut at the start of the MCU's Phase 6, though it's possible that another film could fill in the gap in late 2025, given that Blade was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule. Avengers: Doomsday Cast Info Promised To Be A Massive Cast Link Image Doctor Doom Avengers: Doomsday will revolve around Doctor Doom, who at the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con was announced to be part of the upcoming movie, hence its title. Doctor Doom's casting was also announced, with the iconic MCU Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. set to return to the cinematic universe in this new role . Bringing in Doctor Doom is seemingly a great lead-in to the Secret Wars storyline, as he's also been an antagonist in one of the comic iterations of this narrative. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have begun to talk about Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars , as recent interviews highlight some major points regarding Robert Downey Jr. being cast as Doctor Doom, a decision that has massive implications. In a recent interview with Omelete , Joe Russo talked about Kevin Feige's idea to bring back Robert Downey Jr., stating, \"That was Kevin [Feige], and interesting enough about that was, that conversation was had a while ago. And then Robert tried to talk us into doing it, and we said 'no,' weirdly because we said we wouldn't come back.\" The Fantastic Four All four members of The Fantastic Four will reprise their roles in Avengers: Doomsday. This includes Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing. Given how closely tied the group is with Doctor Doom, they will likely have some of the most significant roles in the entire film. The Thunderbolts Nearly all the Thunderbolts will be coming back for Avengers: Doomsday , which includes Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Wyatt Russell as US Agent, David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, and Lewis Pullman as Sentry. Unfortunately, Taskmaster didn't make the cut, indicating her time in Thunderbolts* will likely be cut short. The Avengers Despite the Avengers breaking up over the course of the MCU, Sam Wilson was determined to assemble a new team following Captain America: Brave New World , and he seems to be doing just that. Alongside Anthony Mackie as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Other Major MCU Characters Alongside the various MCU teams, like Thunderbolts and Avengers, there are a significant number of characters returning in Avengers: Doomsday that have played a significant role in the ", "url": "https://screenrant.com/avengers-doomsday-release-date-cast-story-details/", "domain": "screenrant.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 7, "title": "The Direct 2026's Marvel Studios Movies Will Bring Back 5 Original Avengers", "snippet": "2 weeks ago - While Phase 6 of the MCU kicked ... of fan-favorite Avengers actors in Spider-Man: Brand New Day releasing July 31 and Avengers: Doomsday coming to theaters on December 18....", "full_content": "In 2026, the MCU is returning to its roots with a nostalgic lineup of originalAvengers stars. As the Multiverse Saga approaches its climax, five familiar faces will enter the fray and in more than one movie. While Phase 6 of the MCU kicked off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsand is expected to conclude withAvengers: Secret Warsin 2027,Marvel Studios' 2026 slateis where the action ramps up thanks to the return of fan-favoriteAvengersactors inSpider-Man: Brand New Dayreleasing July 31 andAvengers: Doomsdaycoming to theaters on December 18. Given the Multiversal nature of these projects, fans don't yet know the full extent of all their roles, or just which characters they will play, but these five returning stars are giving longtime MCU fans a reason to get excited all over again. It's no secret amongst Marvel fans that Robert Downey Jr. is back in the MCU, but this time as the Multiversal villain Doctor Doom. While he's the headlining villain ofAvengers: Doomsday, his character has alreadyappeared inThe Fantastic Four: First Steps' post-credits sceneand possibly aboard the Fantastic Four ship in theThunderbolts*tag. The question now is whether he will appear inSpider-Man: Brand New Day, both in the movie or in another post-credits scene, and if Robert Downey Jr. could play another version of his villain or Earth-616 hero in the MultiversalDoomsday. Perhaps the biggest mystery on this list, Chris Evans is heavily rumored to be returning inAvengers: Doomsday; however, it's a claim that the original Captain America star has repeatedly denied. Adding to the fan speculation is the fact that Evans reprised his original Marvel role as Johnny Storm forDeadpool & Wolverinein 2024 and Peggy Carter star Hayley Atwell is already confirmed for the 2026 film. Furthermore, Marvel has yet to clarify his character's still-mysterious post-Endgamefate. Finally, there are rumors claiming Evans may be playingSteve Rogers' alternate identity of Nomad. Clearly, there are multiple ways Chris Evans could make an MCU comeback in 2026, and it will be interesting to see which, if any, prove to be true. Unlike some of his originalAvengersco-stars, Chris Hemsworth has continued Thor's story followingEndgamewithThor: Love and Thunderand is confirmed to pick up the hammer once more inAvengers: Doomsday. (check out the 61 stars confirmed and reported forAvengers 5here) Not only will it be interesting to see how he reacts to Multiversal versions of his former teammate, like Robert Downey Jr.'s Doom, butDoomsdaymay also allow him to finally reunite with his brother Loki. Following his role inShe-Hulkfor Disney+, Mark Ruffalo is headed back to the big screen in 2026 with a role alongside Tom Holland inSpider-Man: Brand New Day. However, Ruffalo may not be playing the Smart Hulk fans have grown accustomed to sinceAvengers: Endgame. Instead, there is some buzz that he may be playingthe destructive Savage Hulk forSpider-Man 4. Whether Ruffalo's Smart Hulk, Savage Hulk, or another version of the gamma-powered green giant will appear inAvengers: Doomsdayremains to be seen. According to reports, Nick Fury still has more to do within the MCU. While Marvel Studios has yet to confirm his role inDoomsday, Samuel L. Jackson is rumored for the 2026 film and where he could potentially bridge both the old and new eras of the MCU. It's also possible he will square off against Val (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) after she branded the Thunderbolts the New Avengers in 2025'sThunderbolts*.

( AP: Uncredited ) In short: Marvel has announced its cast for Avengers: Doomsday, including franchise veterans alongside Fantastic Four newcomers and stalwarts from Fox's X-Men movies. The film is set to release in May 2026, with the sequel Avengers: Secret Wars to follow in May 2027. What's next? The films represent a moment of truth for Marvel Studios after falling box office returns and cooling critical reception to more recent projects. Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Anthony Mackie's Captain America, Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Hiddleston's Loki are all returning to the Avengers ensemble, where they are set to joined by several of cinema's original X-Men. The five veterans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are in the cast of 2026's Avengers: Doomsday, which Marvel announced in a series of videos rolled out slowly overnight. Loading Twitter content Patrick Stewart, 84, who played Professor X in Fox's early-2000s X-Men films, and 85-year-old Ian McKellen, who played his arch-nemesis Magneto, are also in the Doomsday cast as Disney and Marvel seek to take advantage of the acquisition of Fox's movie library. Kelsey Grammer, who played Hank \"Beast\" McCoy, was also announced, as was Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler). Their characters were taken on by younger actors in the 2010s X-Men series reboot. The more senior superheroes will be joined by more recent MCU additions, including some who have yet to make their debuts. Vanessa Kirby, set to play the Invisible Woman Sue Storm in this July's Fantastic Four: First Steps, will also appear in Avengers: Doomsday. Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards will join the Avengers too.

Simu Liu, who played the title character in 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, is also in the newly announced cast, as is Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who played the aquatic antagonist Namor in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Letitia Wright, who plays Shuri in the Black Panther films, will also be back among the Avengers, as will other Black Panther alum Winston Duke. Florence Pugh, who will reprise her MCU role as Yelena Belova in the forthcoming Thunderbolts, will also appear in Doomsday, along with cast mate David Harbour as Red Guardian. Some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's biggest and most anticipated names were not among the 27 names announced, though Marvel and Disney could be sitting on them for now. There was no mention of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine or Ryan Reynolds's Deadpool, though the announcement did include Channing Tatum, who played the X-Men's Gambit in last year's Deadpool & Wolverine. Chris Evans was also absent from the cast list. Tom Holland's name did not appear either. Holland's Spider-Man became an Avenger in previous films. However, the character was on loan from owner Sony, whose complicated relationship with Marvel has made the intellectual property a sticking point. Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr announced he was returning to Marvel Cinematic Universe during the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con. ( Getty Images: Matt Winkelmeyer ) Robert Downey Jr revealed last summer that he will be returning to the MCU to play the villain Doctor Doom in the next set of Avengers films. Avengers: Doomsday, set for release in May 2026, will be the fifth Avengers movie, and the first since 2019's Avengers Endgame became one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Moment of truth for Marvel Marvel has been struggling to recover its cultural buzz and box office mojo ever since Endgame. However, it hopes the forthcoming ensemble films will bring back the magic that dominated cinema for more than a decade. The success of the first 23 films in the franchise — the Infinity Saga — has been difficult to emulate, with the so-called Multiverse Saga seeing the first box office flops in the studio's history: 2021's Eternals and 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Both films also copped \"rotten\" critic scores on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, another first for the MCU. Despite decent reviews , 2023's The Marvels was the MCU's lowest-grossing film ever, failing to break even on its more than $US300 million ($476.4 million) budget.

The MCU has been struggling, and in a rather desperate move, decided to revert back to ‘Avengers’ movies — albeit without Iron Man, Captain America, and Hulk. “Avengers: Doomsday” wrapped its marathon shoot this year, rolling cameras from April 28 until mid-September. Setting aside potential reshoots, the film now gets a luxurious 15-month post-production “break.” Why so much breathing room? Easy — after finishing ‘Doomsday,’ the Russo brothers immediately pivot to its follow-up, “Avengers: Secret Wars.” Both films are rumored to become the costliest in Hollywood history, with budgets said to be in excess of 500M+ (although understandably, we cannot confirm at this time). Hollywood North Buzz now claims “Secret Wars” will mirror the same April-through-September shoot next year in Vancouver. Another 15-month post window. Another VFX behemoth. More endless cameos — it’s all dialed to 11. Expect reshoots, and barely a finished script. Oh, and did I mention the second phase of filming for ‘Doomsday’ — in other words, reshoots — kicks off in January 2026? There were probably some rewrites, maybe even a reshuffled cast list, since Marvel has been locking pieces of this puzzle together right up until the very last second. The official synopsis includes Robert Downey Jr.’s return to Marvel — but this time as Doom himself. Not much else is known about the story being told here. Stephen McFeely and Michael Waldron are credited on the screenplay(s). To give perspective: “Avengers: Endgame” cost $356M to make. ‘Doomsday’ already has $90M publicly accounted for — $40M for the Russos, $50M for Robert Downey Jr. With the avalanche of names reportedly attached, I’d be shocked if the final tally is under $400M. And that’s me being conservative. Marvel continues to push the envelope: how many characters can they squeeze into a single movie before it collapses under its own weight?

It has grown into one of the most popular franchises in modern cinema, with its movies regularly breaking box office records and the franchise weaving itself a place in the fabric of pop culture as a result. As always, Marvel Studios are looking to the future, with several exciting projects on the horizon. Videos by ComicBook.com 2026 is already shaping up to be an important year for the MCU. The year is set to see numerous releases for the franchise, bringing its story toward the conclusion of the Multiverse Saga as part of the build-up to Avengers: Secret Wars .

Marvel Movies Set for 2026 Release Spider-Man: Brand New Day (July 31, 2026) Spider-Man’s fourth solo movie in the MCU is one of the most anticipated projects in the franchise’s near future, largely due to the already exceptional MCU stories which have featured the hero. Subtitled Brand New Day , the movie is set to explore Spider-Man’s work as a New York hero after magically erasing his identity as Peter Parker.

Avengers: Doomsday (December 18, 2026) What may well be one of the most exciting movies in the MCU is also set for a 2026 release in the form of Avengers: Doomsday . The movie is set to introduce long-awaited villain Doctor Doom into the MCU, with Robert Downey Jr. announced to be returning to play the iconic antagonist. Doomsday will also feature an expansive cast of existing MCU heroes, with various actors set to reprise their Marvel roles in the first part of the Multiverse Saga’s conclusion.

An official release date has not been set, but Season 2 is currently slated for release some time in 2026.

He is set to return to the MCU in a mid-length special presentation in the vein of Werewolf by Night and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special . While an official date has not been set, it is currently tipped for a 2026 release.

Regardless, the popularity of Season 1 and the considerable wait for the follow-up makes X-Men ’97 Season 2 yet another exciting Marvel release slated for 2026. 10 Marvel Deaths That the MCU Should Change After Avengers: Secret Wars Tagged: Avengers: Doomsday , List Feature , Marvel Cinematic Universe , Spider-Man: Brand New Day Follow Us ", "url": "https://comicbook.com/movies/news/marvel-movies-tv-shows-releasing-2026-list/", "domain": "comicbook.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 5884}, {"source_number": 11, "title": "Deadline Next 'Avengers' Movies Push Release Dates", "snippet": "May 23, 2025 - Marvel Studios is pushing back the release of its next two Avengers films, directed by the Russo Brothers.

The Marvel movies of 2025 saw the franchise undergo somewhat of a resurgence, with the likes of Thunderbolts* and The Fantastic Four: First Steps being considered a critical return to form for the MCU. The upcoming Marvel movies of 2026 will look to continue this streak, with a slate of exciting projects planned. Despite only having two movies in 2026, Marvel Studios seems set for a good year. This will hopefully be reflected in the box office as much as audience and critical ratings, with many dreaming that 2026 will include two of the best-ranked MCU movies ever . This is without mentioning the various Marvel TV shows that will be released in 2026. 2025 was an illustrious year for Marvel in TV, with the franchise spawning several live-action series as well as a handful of animated efforts. With all that being said, here is a look forward to 2026 for Marvel Studios, from the feature films to the small-screen stories planned. Spider-Man: Brand New Day Tom Holland showing off his Spider-Man: Brand New Day (2026) suit The first Marvel Studios movie being released in 2026 is Spider-Man: Brand New Day . The story of Spider-Man: Brand New Day will follow on from 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home , chronicling Peter Parker's continued exploits in the MCU now that everyone on Earth has forgotten his existence. Directed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton, Spider-Man: Brand New Day is expected to hit theaters on July 31, 2026 . The exact plot of the film has been kept under wraps thus far, but it is expected to be a more street-level Spider-Man movie with Peter entering the next phase of his life. Tom Holland will reprise his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, with several new cast members for Spider-Man: Brand New Day confirmed. Jon Bernthal, Mark Ruffalo, and Michael Mando will reprise their previous MCU roles as The Punisher, Hulk, and Scorpion, respectively. Zendaya's MJ and Jacob Batalon's Ned will also return, though to what extent remains unknown. New cast members include Stranger Things' Sadie Sink and The Bear 's Liza Colon-Zayas. Spider-Man: Brand New Day will look to build on the highly successful Homecoming trilogy, ushering in a new age of the titular Web-Slinger in the MCU and potentially leading to another two movies in the franchise's second Spider-Man trilogy. Avengers: Doomsday Robert Downey Jr sitting in a set chair with the Avengers: Doomsday cast. There are only two Marvel movies in 2026, though they are two of the biggest. Alongside Spider-Man: Brand New Day , Avengers: Doomsday is scheduled to release in theaters on December 18, 2026 ​​​​​​. Avengers: Doomsday 's story has been teased throughout the last few MCU movies, setting up Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the franchise as the villainous Doctor Doom. Originally, Avengers: Doomsday was supposed to be the story of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty . However, Kang the Conqueror actor Jonathan Majors was fired by Marvel after his assault charges, leading to a change in direction. In July 2024, Marvel Studios confirmed Avengers: Doomsday with RDJ as the new Multiverse Saga villain and returning directors, the Russo Brothers, attached . Since then, Avengers: Doomsday 's cast list has been confirmed, with the film shaping up to tell the story of how The Avengers, the New Avengers, The Fantastic Four, and the X-Men will team up to stop whatever sinister plans Doom has for the multiverse. What Doom’s plan is remains to be seen, but The Fantastic Four: First Steps’ post-credit scene teased this. This scene showcased Doctor Doom appearing to Franklin Richards, the incredibly powerful, reality-altering son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm. With Avengers: Doomsday confirmed to tie into 2027's Avengers: Secret Wars, it is clear that Franklin will be important to Doom's plans. Shooting on Avengers: Doomsday is underway until late October 2025, priming the film for its 2026 release. Every MCU Show Releasing In 2026 Daredevil born again poster In comparison to previous years, the MCU is dialing back its TV productions in 2026. However, that is not to say there are none. Three Marvel Television productions are expected in 2026 , with two coming in live-action format and one being animated. Starting with the latter, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2 is expected in 2026. The first season of the animated show that focused on an alternate dimension's Peter Parker was released in January 2025. During an interview with Collider that year, Marvel Studios' Head of Television Brad Winderbaum confirmed that seasons of the show would come annually, with the second coming \"a little bit more than a year\" after its debut.

Dhurandhar spans decades—on and off from the 1970s to today—and plays out between India and Pakistan’s politically charge", "full_content": "Bollywood is getting ready for its most ambitious movie of the year thus far with ‘Dhurandhar,’ a spy thriller helmed by promising director Aditya Dhar. Having made waves earlier with Uri: The Surgical Strike, Dhar comes back to directing with a period action drama that promises to serve up intensity, patriotism, drama, and pulse-pounding action sequences. Starring Ranveer Singh in a gritty new avatar, Dhurandhar has officially dated its release on December 5, 2025, promising to be a big year-end holiday blockbuster. Dhurandhar spans decades—on and off from the 1970s to today—and plays out between India and Pakistan’s politically charged terrains. The narrative is focused on India’s secret intelligence operations and how they evolved, with Ranveer Singh playing one of India’s earliest street-level undercover operatives. His character is going to be intense, complex, and emotionally charged, as it tracks the sacrifices, valor, and strategic genius of early Indian spies. On the other hand, R. Madhavan portrays Ajith Doval, the actual Indian National Security Advisor who is famous for his contributions to intelligence. His character serves as the narrative anchor, guiding the audience through the film’s unfolding mission and giving the film a grounded connection to real-life national security events. It is the debut collaborative effort of Aditya Dhar and Ranveer Singh, and with Uri setting the benchmark for patriotic action films, the onus lies with Dhurandhar to not just meet but exceed expectations. Supporting Ranveer and Madhavan is a supporting cast full of veteran talent. The film boasts the presence of Sanjay Dutt, Akshaye Khanna, Yami Gautam, and Arjun Rampal—all in important roles that contribute to the multi-layered story. Even the casting has been a buzz, with the fans so excited to watch such fine actors on the big screen together. The teaser of Dhurandhar was launched on the birthday of Ranveer Singh on July 6, 2025—aptly enough—and it broke the internet in mere minutes. It starts off with a slow-motion, dramatic back shot of Ranveer, hinting at his brooding, raw avatar. The tone is engrossing, helped along by the commanding voiceover of R. Madhavan, establishing the foundation of what appears to be a story of sacrifice, shadow, and spycraft. While the teaser is action-packed and dramatic, there is an unexpected addition of humor also. Dhar, who is known for striking a balance between emotion and action, introduces this element with subtlety without watering down the severity of the theme. Ranveer’s “ghatak” (fatal) persona is winning hearts on the web—not only for the grooming, but also for the impactful delivery of the dialogue. One of the highlight points from the teaser that immediately caught the attention of all was a fiery dialogue from Ranveer: This immediately brought back comparisons with Sunny Deol’s cult dialogues of the 90s and had fans going on a nostalgia trip. The open nod to Ghayal and Ghatak, two of Sunny Deol’s cult films, brings in a dash of masala that today’s viewers adore and respects, as a tribute, the legends of Bollywood cinema. The teaser has received rave reviews from fans and industry stakeholders alike. Actor Arjun Kapoor shared his excitement on social media, commenting: “Beast mode on 🔥💣 Panjabi MC + Aditya Dhar + Baba = Khatarnak combo!!! Cannot wait for 5th Dec 🙌.” Vikrant Massey joined in too, calling the teaser simply As per trade insiders, only 25 days of shooting remain, which will be completed by early September 2025. Impressively, post-production is already underway in parallel. The team plans to lock the final edit by the end of October, allowing for a 45-day promotional campaign starting around Diwali. The film was initially eyeing two release windows—December 5, 2025, and January 9, 2026—but the makers have now finalized the December date. However, there’s still a minor chance of a last-minute shift, although currently, all posters and promotional content are aligned with the December release. The release places Dhurandhar in direct competition with Prabhas’ ‘Raja Saab’ and Shahid Kapoor’s ‘Romeo,’ directed by Vishal Bhardwaj. But insiders suggest that Romeo might move to January 2026, clearing the way for a more open box office window. Dhurandhar marks Ranveer Singh’s return to cinemas after the critical and commercial success of Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani. Famous for his dedication, energy, and screen presence, Ranveer seems to have done things a step up with this tough, action-oriented character. With a compelling narrative, real-life inspiration, cinema-like treatment, and an emotionally charged undertone, ‘Dhurandhar’ is turning out to be one of the hottest Bollywood releases in the past few years.

A minor calculation change was made recently to improve this indicator and overall score for Fear & Greed Index.", "full_content": "What emotion is driving the market now?Learn more about the index It’s useful to look at stock market levels compared to where they’ve been over the past few months. When the S&P 500 is above its moving or rolling average of the prior 125 trading days, that’s a sign of positive momentum. But if the index is below this average, it shows investors are getting skittish. The Fear & Greed Index uses slowing momentum as a signal for Fear and a growing momentum for Greed. A few big stocks can skew returns for the market. It’s important to also know how many stocks are doing well versus those that are struggling. This shows the number of stocks on the NYSE at 52-week highs compared to those at 52-week lows. When there are many more highs than lows, that’s a bullish sign and signals Greed. The market is made up of thousands of stocks. And on any given day, investors are actively buying and selling them. This measure looks at the amount, or volume, of shares on the NYSE that are rising compared to the number of shares that are falling. A low (or even negative) number is a bearish sign. The Fear & Greed Index uses decreasing trading volume as a signal for Fear. Options are contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell stocks, indexes or other financial securities at an agreed upon price and date. Puts are the option to sell while calls are the option to buy. When the ratio of puts to calls is rising, it is usually a sign investors are growing more nervous. A ratio above 1 is considered bearish. The Fear & Greed Index uses a bearish options ratio as a signal for Fear. The most well-known measure of market sentiment is the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX. The VIX measures expected price fluctuations or volatility in the S&P 500 Index options over the next 30 days. The VIX often drops on days when the broader market rallies and soars when stocks plunge. But the key is to look at the VIX over time. It tends to be lower in bull markets and higher when the bears are in control. The Fear & Greed Index uses increasing market volatility as a signal for Fear. Stocks are riskier than bonds. But the reward for investing in stocks over the long haul is greater. Still, bonds can outperform stocks over short periods. Safe Haven Demand shows the difference between Treasury bond and stock returns over the past 20 trading days. Bonds do better when investors are scared. The Fear & Greed Index uses increasing safe haven demand as a signal for Fear. Note: The frequent drops of the yield spread on the Junk Bond Demand chart usually appear on the ex-dividend date. The spread typically bounces back after the dividend is paid and normalizes over time. Junk bonds carry a higher risk of default compared to other bonds. Bond yields – or the return you get on investing in a bond - dip when prices go up. If investors crave junk bonds, the yields drop. Likewise, yields rise when people are selling. So a smaller difference (or spread) between yields for junk bonds and safer government bonds is a sign investors are taking on more risk. A wider spread shows more caution. The Fear & Greed Index uses junk bond demand as a signal for Greed. The Fear & Greed Index is a way to gauge stock market movements and whether stocks are fairly priced. The theory is based on the logic that excessive fear tends to drive down share prices, and too much greed tends to have the opposite effect. The Fear & Greed Index is a compilation of seven different indicators that measure some aspect of stock market behavior. They are market momentum, stock price strength, stock price breadth, put and call options, junk bond demand, market volatility, and safe haven demand. The index tracks how much these individual indicators deviate from their averages compared to how much they normally diverge. The index gives each indicator equal weighting in calculating a score from 0 to 100, with 100 representing maximum greediness and 0 signaling maximum fear. Every component and the Index are calculated as soon as new data becomes available. The Fear & Greed Index is used to gauge the mood of the market. Many investors are emotional and reactionary, and fear and greed sentiment indicators can alert investors to their own emotions and biases that can influence their decisions. When combined with fundamentals and other analytical tools, the Index can be a helpful way to assess market sentiment.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed", "domain": "cnn.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 0.9700000000000001, "content_length": 4397}, {"source_number": 2, "title": "Reliance Inc (RS) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Record ...", "snippet": "Oct 23, 2025 · Reliance Inc (RS) outperforms industry with increased market share and robust cash flow, while navigating competitive pricing and inventory pressures.", "full_content": "Reliance Inc (RS) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Highlights: Record Sales and Strategic Growth Amid ...

Positive Points Reliance Inc ( NYSE:RS ) achieved a third-quarter record for tons sold, outperforming the industry by approximately 9 percentage points. The company increased its US market share to 17.1%, up from 14.5% in 2023, due to its smart, profitable growth strategy. Reliance Inc ( NYSE:RS ) generated approximately $262 million in operating cash flow in the third quarter, which was strategically redeployed into high-value initiatives. The company returned $124 million to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Reliance Inc ( NYSE:RS ) maintained a strong financial position with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 1, providing significant liquidity for capital allocation priorities. Negative Points Trade policy uncertainty and readily available inventory have created a competitive market, making it difficult to increase selling prices to offset mill price increases. The aerospace and semiconductor markets, which typically contribute meaningfully to profits, continue to underperform due to excess inventories. Gross profit margins have faced headwinds due to competitive pricing environments and excess inventories in certain markets. The company experienced a $1.03 per share unfavorable year-over-year LIFO impact due to changes in inventory accounting. Reliance Inc ( NYSE:RS ) anticipates a typical sequential seasonality decline in earnings per share of approximately 20 to 25% in the fourth quarter. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q : Is the current gross margin compression due to your focus on growing volumes? A : Karla Lewis, President and CEO: The compression is primarily due to the challenging market environment, not our growth strategy. While our strategy involves growing tons with profitable business, the market's unique conditions, such as tariff-driven price increases without corresponding demand, have impacted margins. Specialty products in aerospace and semiconductor sectors have also pressured margins. Our growth strategy remains focused on maintaining a sustainable gross profit margin of 29-31%. Q : Can you explain the increase in inventory levels despite the current market environment? A : Karla Lewis, President and CEO: The increase is partly due to higher mill prices and a slight uptick in tons. We buy based on shipping needs, and having inventory on hand allows us to win business and better serve customers, especially as competitors pull back. Q : How close are we to resolving the excess inventory issue, and is it affecting your competitors or customers? A : Karla Lewis, President and CEO: Excess inventory at both mill and service center levels has been a challenge, but we believe inventories have come down. We are seeing positive signs like extended lead times for certain products. While we may be nearing an inflection point, we are cautious in declaring destocking over. Q : How does Reliance win new business? Is it through execution or pricing? A : Karla Lewis, President and CEO: Our strategy focuses on execution, not price. We have expanded processing capabilities and emphasize high customer service levels. Our ability to serve small orders on a just-in-time basis has been advantageous in the current market, and we expect to retain much of the new business we've won. Q : Can you provide insights into the M&A landscape and valuations? A : Karla Lewis, President and CEO: We are seeing a steady flow of opportunities, with the market picking up to normal levels. Valuations are generally reasonable, and we continue to evaluate opportunities that align with our growth strategy.

The stock, which moved 16.5% higher in a month declined 9% today from its record high to finally close in the red. The euphoria around the stock ahead of the 43rd AGM fizzled out as Chairman Mukesh Ambani opened the meeting. Analysts said sell-off in Reliance Industries stock came as investors followed principle of buy on expectations and sell on announcements. RIL stock fell up to 9.12% to Rs 1,798 compared to a high of Rs 1978.50 it achieved in the afternoon session.The fall came in the last hour of trade as the 43rd AGM of RIL was in progress. Market cap of the firm fell to Rs 11.50 lakh crore on BSE. Total 25.28 lakh shares changed hands on BSE amounting to turnover of Rs 489.05 crore. Reliance Industries stock ended 3.71% or Rs 71 lower against previous close of Rs 1,845 on BSE. On Sensex, the share was second-biggest loser after Bharti Airtel which lost 4.24% to close at Rs 564. Deepak Jasani, Head, Retail Research at HDFC Securities said,\"The AGM was once again a platform for showcasing the progress made by the company in its various businesses. The way the stock markets seesawed post 2 pm (when the AGM began) showed the importance of Reliance stock for the Indian markets. The stock price had moved up around 16.5% in this month anticipating announcements at the AGM. Most of the announcements were in line with expectations built till yesterday and the stock price has reacted on the principle of buy on expectations and sell on announcements.\" The stock was top loser on Nifty slipping 3.89% or Rs 74 to Rs 1,842 against previous close of Rs 1,917. Earlier, the stock hit an all-time high of Rs 1,978 on the 50-stock index today. The stock hit intra day low of Rs 1798, down 6.18% against previous close. Reliance Industries first Indian company to cross Rs 1 lakh crore EBITDA-mark, says Mukesh Ambani RIL and Saudi Aramco had signed a non-binding letter of intent in August 2019 wherein Saudi Aramco was looking at picking up a 20% stake in the O2C business at an enterprise value of $75 bn. It is now clear that investment by any strategic investor in the O2C business will happen at a lower valuation which was one of the reasons why the stock sold off post the AGM. Moreover, investors were also expecting concrete timelines on the proposed listing of Jio Platforms which was not provided by the management and was also a cause for disappointment. However investment by Google for a 7.7% stake in the company was a key positive announcement in the AGM,\" Roy said. RIL share price has gained 21.35% since the beginning of this year and 44% during the last one year. The large cap stock hit a fresh 52-week low of Rs 867 on March 23, 2020. Since then, the stock has gained nearly 125% on BSE. Total 2.27 lakh shares changed hands on BSE amounting to turnover of Rs 44.04 crore.

Despite the increase, the average revenue per user (ARPU) will work out to Rs 141, half of what it had originally said it wanted to achieve. With the increase, the most popular plan which promises unlimited voice usage and a data consumption of 1GB/day for 84 days will cost Rs 459, a hike for Rs 60. The company has also reduced the benefit under Rs 509 scheme, which offers 2 GB of data per day, by reducing its validity or billing cycle from 56 to 49 days. The tariffs are effective October 19. Shares of Reliance Industries, the parent company which owns Reliance Jio, hit an all-time high of Rs 929.95 in early trade on Monday and analysts attribute the rise to positive news flow on the Jio front. Says an analysts with domestic brokerage house: “Slowly but surely, the uncertainly over Jio is clearing out and if, Jio becomes cash positive in the near future, the stock can go up 50% in one year.” As India’s growth story gains momentum and the number of billionaires rises, the country’s luxury market is seeing a boom like never before, with the taste for luxury moving beyond the metros. From high-end watches and jewellery to lavish residences and luxurious holidays, Indians are splurging like never before. Storied luxury brands are rushing in to satiate this demand, often roping in Indian celebs as ambassadors. In the last one year, the Reliance stock price has gone up nearly 100% - a rally that started shortly after Jio’s services was launched informally and for free. Analysts at that time re-rated the stock saying that the launch of Jio took away uncertainly around the project, which was delayed by 24 months and has costed the company over Rs 150,000 crore without earning the company a rupee in revenue. The company’s market capitalisation is now at Rs 605,000 crore and is again the most valuable company in the country. The tariff increase comes after the reduction of Interconnect usage charges (IUC) last month by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India or Trai. The IUC charges, which Jio had to pay everytime its customers made voice calls to another network, worked out to Rs 2100 crore in the September quarter. This added to directly added to Jio’s losses as all voice calls on its network are free for its customers. The cut in IUC from 14 paise a minute to 6 paise a minute will result in a saving of Rs 3800 crore for Jio, estimate analysts. It is not immediately clear how many of Jio’s 130 million will eventually renew their subscription or adopt the new plans. Before the new plan came into force, the company had allowed a seven day window starting October 12 when existing customers could renew their plans at old rates. The renewal would come into force only when their existing plans expired. As a bonus for renewal, the company provided eight discount vouchers worth Rs50 each to customers who recharged Rs 399 between 12 and 18 October. More clarity on the success of the new plan will be evident only at the end of the third quarter in December 2017, which is expected to be amongst the worst quarters for the incumbent players like Airtel, Vodafone and Idea. However, the prospect of an end of a tariff war has also bought good cheer to telecom stocks. As Reliance inched up to its all time high, on Monday, Bharti Airtel moved by smartly by Rs 23 or 4.80% to Rs 496.75 and Aditya Birla-owned Idea Cellular moved up by Rs 6.80 or 7.23% to Rs 97.80. These firms, hit by the impact of goods and services tax, or GST, and a 57% cut in interconnection usage charges (IUC), have been posting increased losses after Jio launched it services.

It calculates the present value of a company's forecasted cash flows based on selected operating model. Adjust key parameters like discount rate and terminal growth, and alter inputs such as revenue growth and margins to see their impact on valuation. Switching the operating model will discard any changes made to the current valuation. You already have a valuation model for Reliance Industries Ltd. Do you want to replace it with the current valuation model? Do you really want to delete your valuation model? This operation cannot be undone. This stage translates the present value into DCF value per share. For firm valuation models, it adjusts present value for debt and assets to derive equity value (skipped if using equity valuation model). Finally, this equity value is divided by the number of shares to determine the DCF value per share.

Thanks to a spurt in the Nifty Bank, the Nifty50 has managed to surpass its April 5 high of 9,273 by breaching the 9,300 level for the first time ever. The banking index, too, has risen to a record high since April 18 this year. The BSE Sensex climbed over 250 points in early trade on Tuesday. So what is fuelling this sharp rally in the market despite so much concern over valuations? Going by the buzz on Dalal Street, here are the top factors driving this rally. French elections 1-0: The Round 1 of French elections, which was held on April 23, went to Centrist Emmanuel Macron. In case you don’t know who Macron is, he is the presidential candidate, a pro-European Union ex-banker, whose win could ensure an avoidance of a Brexit-like situation in France – the third largest EU economy. Macron won the first round of voting and qualified for a May 7 runoff alongside far-right leader Marine Le Pen. European indices, such as CAC40 of France, German DAX and the UK’s FTSE100 soared up to 4 per cent. US stocks closed 1 per cent higher in overnight trade. And now Dalal Street is seeing some rub-off. RIL at nine-year high: Ever since Reliance Jio started ringing, the stock is ringing too, so loud that shares of Reliance Industries hit a nine-year high in Tuesday’s trade. With a 3 per cent jump in early trade, Reliance Industries market-cap has zoomed past the Rs 4.7 lakh crore mark. Well, it is not Reliance Jio but RIL’s refining performance that did the wonders. That the company clocked the higher margins over its Asian peers is something the market really liked. Brokerage Morgan Stanley, which has a target price of Rs 1,506 for the stock, said timelines on energy project execution should raise confidence in earnings delivery. Live Events F&O expiry: While global cues, strength in the shares of RIL and other banking stocks made investors turn bullish, one could not undermine the role of short coverings ahead of the expiry of April series F&O contracts. Marketwide rollovers stood at 23 per cent till Monday, which were lower than the average of 26 per cent seen during the comparable period of last three series. Rollover of Nifty futures stood at 32 per cent on D-3, which was higher compared with the average rollover of 26 per cent seen in last three series. Hope of earnings recovery: RIL’s Q4 results have spurred sentiment. The numbers from blue chip IT firms were not that poor either. There have been hopes that the implementation of GST from July 1 could give a big push to the organised sector. Listed firms in sectors with large unorganised markets are gaining as the new tax would create a level-playing field. “We will review the Nifty50 numbers and target after the fourth quarter results are announced. When we take the next strategy call, we think GST will be a big catalyst. If it is rolled out on time on July 1, that will be a positive factor. For FY18, the consensus earnings growth rate is between 12 per cent and 15 per cent, which is not easy to achieve. That is where the challenge is going to be. If numbers do come, then the market has further steam, because there is lot of liquidity and lot of investors are hunting for new ideas in the market,” said Jigar Shah, CEO at Kim Eng Securities. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now! Liquidity: Though FPIs’ love for debt is impartial, equity has not been out of their sight. Data showed foreign investors have bought equities worth Rs 2,382 crore this month, though it is far lower than Rs 4,500 crore inflows to equity in the first week of this month. Money comes and goes, but trust remains. A recent survey by Credit Suisse among 2,500 institutional investors, hedge funds, HNIs holding over $18 trillion in assets, 330 companies from 15 countries, besides renowned policy makers and political leaders, showed India and China have been the two most overweight bets of FPIs in the Asian region.

Which Reliance Stock is Best to Buy in India? By Moneyexcel Editor Last Update December 5, 2024 6 Minutes Read Investing in the stock market can feel like standing at the edge of a cliff, unsure whether to dive into the sparkling blue sea or back away to safety. If you’ve been considering Reliance stocks, you’re not alone! Reliance is a name that excites seasoned investors and newcomers alike. Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) has been a powerhouse in India’s corporate landscape for decades, making it one of the most attractive picks for investors. But here’s the burning question: among its diversified business interests, which Reliance stock is the best to buy? Let’s break it down piece by piece so you can make a well-informed decision. Why Reliance Stocks Are Always in the Spotlight Reliance Industries isn’t just another conglomerate; it’s a financial titan. Under the visionary leadership of Mukesh Ambani, the company has transformed from a textile business into a diversified empire that dominates energy, telecom, retail, and digital services. Let’s think of Reliance as a tree with multiple branches. Each branch represents a business vertical contributing to its robust growth. From Reliance Jio revolutionizing telecommunications to Reliance Retail capturing the hearts (and wallets) of millions of Indians, the company thrives on innovation and market disruption. Here’s why Reliance stocks often make headlines: Diversified Portfolio – Reliance operates across sectors like oil and gas, retail, telecom, and clean energy. This makes its stock relatively stable and less prone to sector-specific shocks. Growth Potential – With ambitious projects like renewable energy and 5G rollouts, Reliance continues to position itself as a future-ready company. Strong Leadership – Mukesh Ambani’s ability to foresee market trends and make bold moves sets the company apart. Now, let’s break down the key stocks under the Reliance umbrella and explore which one could be your golden ticket. Which Reliance Stock is Best to Buy in India? Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) – The Crown Jewel Why Consider RIL? If Reliance Industries were a symphony, RIL would be the conductor. It’s the parent company and the driving force behind all subsidiaries. Investing in RIL gives you a slice of its core business operations, including oil refining, petrochemicals, and its stake in Jio and retail ventures. Key Highlights Market Performance – RIL is a heavyweight on the NSE and BSE, often included in major indices like the NIFTY 50. Dividend Payout – It consistently rewards shareholders with dividends, making it a reliable option for long-term investors. Future Prospects – With its aggressive push into green energy, including hydrogen fuel and solar power, RIL is eyeing the next big wave of global energy trends. Who Should Buy RIL? RIL is ideal for those who prefer stability with growth potential. It’s like the Swiss Army knife of stocks—versatile and dependable. Jio Financial Services – King of Reliance Finance Why Consider Jio Financial Services? Jio Financial Services is a subsidiary of Reliance Industries , the Indian conglomerate known for its dominance across energy, telecom, and retail sectors. Reliance’s crown jewel, Jio , revolutionized India’s telecom industry. Now, Jio Financial Services is all set to shake up the financial sector. Jio Financial Services aims to provide a wide array of financial solutions, including lending, insurance, wealth management, and digital payments. In essence, it’s Reliance’s big move into the fintech and banking space, and it’s coming in hot. Key Highlights Backed by Reliance Industries – When you’re investing in Jio Financial Services, you’re not just betting on a standalone company—you’re putting your faith in Reliance Industries. Reliance has a proven track record of disrupting industries and creating shareholder value. Untapped Potential in India’s Financial Sector – India’s financial services sector is massive, but it’s still got so much room to grow. A large chunk of the population remains underserved or completely unbanked. This creates a golden opportunity for Jio Financial service s to swoop in with innovative, tech-driven solutions. Diversified Revenue Streams – From lending and insurance to digital wallets and investment platforms, JFS has its fingers in many pies. This diversification reduces risk and ensures steady revenue growth across different market cycles. It’s not a one-trick pony—it’s a financial juggernaut in the making . Reliance Jio: The Telecom Trailblazer Why Consider Reliance Jio? Imagine a world without mobile data. Scary, right? Reliance Jio changed the game by making data affordable and accessible to millions. As the leading telecom provider in India, Jio is now venturing into 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and digital platforms.

(Photo: Reuters) India Today Web Desk New Delhi , UPDATED: Dec 8, 2020 15:32 IST Domestic stock markets in India have performed exceptionally well over the last few months and most experts predict the record-breaking rally to continue next year — a huge feat considering the dreaded impact of the coronavirus pandemic on global markets, with some still struggling to recover. At the moment, stock markets in India are peaking new highs every day as sentiments remain strong on hopes of an early coronavirus vaccine. But there is another factor that cannot be ignored — the growth of India’s largest company, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). advertisement RIL and India’s stock market growth Reliance shares have grown handsomely during the pandemic against all odds. Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of RIL, has been on a mission to expand the conglomerate from its traditional energy and oil business. According to data compiled by Bloomberg , RIL accounted for nearly a fifth of the 75 per cent surge in the S&P BSE Sensex since March. That is literally double the contribution of Apple Inc has made to gains in the S&P 500 index over the same period. Market experts said Reliance’s recent fundraising drive has sharply increased its stock market valuation. They expect RIL's valuation to further rise next year, indicating that the company's stockholders are in a sweet spot at the moment. Reliance 2020 growth story The reliance growth story in 2020 has been largely about transitioning its traditional energy business to become a more digitally-focused company . Despite all the challenges, including the economic slowdown triggered by the pandemic, experts say Reliance has done extremely well in outlining its future goals and working towards the transition. As of today, Reliance stock is trading over Rs 2,000 after a 2.5 per cent upward rally. Also Read | Sensex, Nifty at record highs as IT shares surge; RIL gains over 2% The fresh rally comes after Ambani announced that Jio 5G will be available from 2021 during his address at the fourth edition of the India Mobile Congress. Ambani said the company plans to roll out the service in the second half of 2021. But this is just a fraction of what Reliance has managed to do in 2020. Over the year, Ambani has reduced the company’s debt substantially, launched a mega rights issue and even managed to find prominent global investors to invest in his new technology and retail ventures. These companies have invested billions of dollars in RIL’s Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL), both of which are expected to become flagship businesses of the conglomerate. Ambani, who is the richest man in Asia, had started transitioning his business a few years ago with the launch of Reliance Jio — a network that led to drastic changes in India’s telecom sector. advertisement While Jio has now become a hit among millions of Indian, its new offerings including 5G, JioTV+ and JioGlass are likely to have a similar impact on the industry. Moreover, Reliance is also working on a model to capture a substantial chunk of India’s vast retail sector, especially the lucrative online grocery business.

In short, most retail investors or newbie investors make the below mistake as a result they do not get the maximum return on their investing. These rules apply to the maximum sectors’ stocks. If you are new in the market or don’t have enough knowledge, you should follow the rules to strengthen your self-psychology. Rule #1: Do not invest all the money in one sector’s stocks. No matter what is the future of the sector. In case you invested all the money in one sector, if the sector faces any issue, you’ll be in a huge loss. Rule #2: Invest a maximum of 5% – 6% of the total money in any stock. Suppose you have Rs. 1 Lakh and invest only 5000 – 6000 in any stock. This rule is applicable when you are retail, and can not track all the stocks. Rule #3: Invest in a maximum of 2-3 sector stocks. When any sector faces problems then other sectors’ stock will save you from huge losses.

Reliance has been demonstrating a strong momentum this week, thanks to firm global oil prices, structural transformations across its businesses, bullish target revisions. That momentum has raised the prospect of retesting its record high. The stock closed Wednesday’s session near twelve-month highs of ₹1,551, although it decline later in the day to register 1.28% in intraday losses. Nonetheless, that session brought Reliance (BSE: RELIANCE) within striking distance of its lifetime peak near ₹1,608, and a bullish undercurrent remains in play. The recent momentum reflects both sectoral tailwinds and company-specific developments that are drawing investor attention. One of the primary drivers is the recovery in global crude oil prices. With U.S. shale production slowing and OPEC+ maintaining supply cuts, oil benchmarks are trending higher, directly benefiting Reliance’s core refining and petrochemical businesses. The market is responding positively to this. Investors have been pricing in improved gross refining margins, which are key profit levers for the company. Beyond energy, Reliance Industries share price long-term narrative remains compelling. The company continues to invest aggressively in new energy, including solar, green hydrogen, and battery storage. Elsewhere, its digital arm, Jio Platforms, remains a growth engine, bolstered by continued subscriber additions and expansions into AI, cloud, and fintech ecosystems. Also, Investors are watching for clarity on potential IPO timelines for Jio and Reliance Retail, as well as updates on its clean energy roadmap. In addition, the upcoming Q1 release and AGM updates could significantly influence the Reliance Industries share price trajectory in the final week of July. Reliance Industries Share Price Prediction Reliance Industries share price pivots at ₹1,515 and the momentum calls for further upside. The stock will likely rise up and encounter initial resistance at ₹1,40. However, a stronger momentum will break above that level and could extend the upside to test ₹1,560. On the other hand, going below ₹1,515 will invite the sellers to take control. That could see initial support established at ₹1,500. Breaking below that level will invalidate the upside narrative, and the resulting momentum could push the price lower to test ₹1,483. This article was originally published on InvestingCube.com .

Tree Paine accused anonymous celebrity gossip account, Deuxmoi, of causing \"pain and trauma\" after it made the claims. In an Instagram Story, Deuxmoi said the Cruel Summer hitmaker married Joe in 2020 or 2021 in a non-legal ceremony. \"Enough is enough with these fabricated lies about Taylor from Deuxmoi,\" Tree wrote on X/Twitter. \"There was NEVER a marriage or ceremony of ANY kind.\" News of Taylor and Joe splitting made headlines in May 2023, with the Shake It Off star since being linked with NFL player Travis Kelce. Deuxmoi later responded to Tree's post, writing that they \"make zero dollars from lying\", then querying \"can publicists say the same\". \"Either way, I apologise to Taylor,\" the post ended. Getty Images News of Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's split hit headlines earlier this year Tree has led Taylor's publicity team since 2014, and has often been seen at events with Taylor, such as the London premiere of Beyoncé's Renaissance tour film. The 12-time Grammy award winner previously told a fan that Tree \"tells me what to do\". Taylor has just released You're Losing Me on streaming services, which many fans think is about the decline of her and Joe's relationship. But Jack Antonoff, Taylor's collaborator, said the song was recorded on 5 December 2021 - before Joe and Taylor split. What is Deuxmoi? The account has over two million followers on Instagram and claims to be a \"curator of pop culture\". It's known for posting anonymous messages from unverified sources about celebrities - covering everything from relationship news to music, film and product releases. \"Some statements made on this account have not been independently confirmed,\" Deuxmoi's Instagram bio reads. \"This account does not claim information published is based in fact.\" Why are we obsessed with Taylor Swift's love life?

Tuesday's post by the couple - who have been together for two years - has been liked more than 28 million times on the social media platform. NFL star Kelce is pictured getting down on one knee to pop the question to the world-famous music superstar, with the pair gazing into each other's eyes and embracing. In the third picture in the carousel, Swift, wearing a Ralph Lauren halter neck dress and diamond encrusted Cartier watch, flashes her engagement ring - a cushion cut diamond on a gold band. @TaylorSwift/Instagram According to US reports, the ring was purchased from Artifex Fine Jewelery. Prices for rings on its website start at around $29,000 (£21,506.26). Photos show the couple surrounded by roses, anemones, delphiniums and hydrangeas which appear to be set up in woodland with strategically placed urns and an archway, wedding florist Nicola Paul told the BBC. \"It's simple elegance, not too ostentatious,\" she said. \"It's been staged in the woods, so you get that lush greenery look.\" Celebrity florist Jeff Leatham, who has worked with the Kardashians, described the design as \"beautiful, hidden secret garden with a romantic mix of florals\". The engagement post was not without some elements of an Easter egg hunt - a thing Swift loves doing for her fans around the world. The caption had the explosion emoji which could also be read as TNT - or T and T: Taylor's and Travis' initials when abbreviated. Neither Swift nor Kelce have been publicly engaged to anyone before. 'Feel so high school' Accompanying the Instagram post is Swift's ballad So High School from the Tortured Poets Department album - rumoured to have been written about Kelce. \"I feel so high school every time I look at you,\" she sings. The clip of the song finishes on the line \"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me?\" which apparently is a reference to a 2016 interview in which Kelce chose to kiss Taylor in a game of Kiss, Marry, Kill. \"That was so magical and special to see,\" said Dr Iona Murphy, an adviser on last year's Victoria and Albert Museum's exhibition on Swift and a superfan who has written about Swift. \"A song that was written about Travis was now being used on the post. It's a nice full circle moment,\" said Dr Murphy, an English literature lecturer at Huddersfield University. She said the caption to the Instagram announcement - \"your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married\" – is also notable, as it refers to how the fans like to describe the couple. \"That's like a little joke in the fandom. You see it on social media. So it's like that was a little nod to the fans,\" she said. In an interview with ABC's News 5 Cleveland station, Kelce's father, Ed, revealed that \"Travis actually did the proposal... maybe two weeks, not quite two weeks ago\". He said this happened at a garden in the city of Lee's Summit, Missouri. \"He got her out there, they were about to go out to dinner, and he said, 'let's go out and have a glass of wine'... they got out there, and that's when he asked her, and it was beautiful,\" Ed Kelce said. \"They started FaceTiming me and their mother and her folks to make sure everybody knew. So, to see them together is great.\" @TaylorSwift/Instragram Fans scream in shock The pop emergency has resonated with fans in an extraordinary way. Videos on social media show groups of friends screaming as they heard the news, while others describe feeling emotional and even teary. \"I thought it was AI when I first opened up Instagram,\" Chloe, who runs a Swiftie news fan account with 74,000 followers on TikTok, told the BBC. \"I couldn't believe it was real, then I realised it was their accounts that posted it,\" she said. \"I immediately freaked out and text my group chat incoherently. Just excitement and disbelief, really.\" As the news broke, many Swift fans were joking on social media that they were happy for their \"close friend\" Swift. Swift recognised early on in her career the benefit of connecting with fans, and has carefully crafted a sense of relatability. And at the same time, many of Swift's original fans - who were teenagers at the same time as Swift was breaking through as an artist - have grown up with her, and are now at the same age when they may also be getting engaged or married. Explaining why she felt so strongly about the engagement, Chloe said: \"I feel in a way we all know her. \"Her music is so personal, and the way she connects to her fans is through the way she talks and sings abou", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzdpk3xwjo", "domain": "bbc.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 3, "title": "BBC Taylor Swift announces engagement to Travis Kelce - BBC News", "snippet": "August 27, 2025 - \" Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married \", the singer writes in a post on Instagram.", "full_content": "\"Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.\" With that one-line, five-picture Instagram post, signed off with a fire cracker emoji, Taylor Swift announced her engagement to American football player Travis Kelce, sending the internet into a frenzy.

Not only has Travis' family had wonderful things to say about Taylor, but the NFL player has been sweetly supportive of his girlfriend as she travels the world on her Eras Tour, even appearing onstage during one of her London gigs . And in recent months, engagement speculation has ramped up. In June, Travis' comments about wedding planning went viral and fans began to question whether or not the pair were secretly engaged. Just a few weeks later, Taylor was spotted wearing a new piece of jewellery - a sweet Tiffany & Co. ring with two side-by-side T's - and many continued to wonder if the couple has taken their relationship to the next level. Now, a number of Swifties are convinced that a new photo 'proves' the rumours are true - and it's all down to a seemingly innocent snap of Travis' suite at the Arrowhead Stadium. The sportsman plays for the Kansas City Chiefs, and when one fan shared a photo of his suite at the stadium in Missouri it quickly started doing the rounds on X (formerly Twitter). The image shows that Travis' suite includes a poster from Taylor's Eras Tour, with the person overlaying the photo with the caption: \"This is where Taylor gets to sit! Also the fact that there is an eras tour poster in this room is so funny to me.\" This is so cute and a eras tour poster in Travs suite pic.twitter.com/L7EhiHPP4Q July 27, 2024 Fans took to social media to claim that the pair may have secretly married, with one person writing: \"I’m sorry but these two are married. They’ll never announce it and they totally don’t have to. She’ll tell us in TS12 probably but this is some married people shit.\" Another person added: \"Taylor and Travis are probably already married and we just have no idea.\" However not everyone is convinced that Taylor and Travis are married, with one person arguing: \"There is no evidence to suggest that Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are married.

She also famously shook off a scandal when she was accused of lying by Kim Kardashian and Kanye West , the latter of whom released footage from a phone call with the singer where they spoke about him using the line 'I made that b**** famous\" in one of his songs. He was referring to the infamous moment he interrupted Taylor's acceptance speech at the VMAs, storming up on stage to announce Beyonce deserved the win, not her. ‌ Taylor claimed she didn't agree to being called a \"b****\" and she didn't approve the song's \"misogynistic message\". 3 View 3 Images Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have been together since 2016 (Image: WP Pix / SplashNews.com) 3 View 3 Images Taylor's fans are convinced they've already tied the knot - or are at least engaged (Image: GC Images) ‌ In response, Kim hinted that Taylor was a \"snake\" in a tweet celebrating \"national snake day\", leading to her fans littering Taylor's social media comment section with snake emojis. Taylor fell off the radar for several years before releasing her comeback album Reputation in 2017, in which she sang about being hated and gossiped about. Having taking some time away from the public eye, Taylor appeared strong and keen for vengeance, and her lyrics insisted she no longer cared about what people thought about her. ‌ And something that may have informed her new carefree attitude was her new boyfriend, British actor Joe Alwyn. Taylor and Joe kept their romance under wraps for a while - in stark contrast to the publicity stunts with her exes Tom Hiddleston and Calvin Harris. They are thought to have met at the 2016 Met Gala , and were subsequently spotted at a Kings of Leon concert and at Taylor's home in Nashville where it was presumed Joe was meeting his girlfriend's family. ‌ View 3 Images Taylor wore a chunky ring on her left ring finger, sparking engagement rumours (Image: NETFLIX) Get the news you want straight to your inbox. Sign up for a Mirror newsletter here . In 2017, Taylor released a diary entry from January that read: \"We have been together and no one has found out for 3 months now. I want it to stay that way because I don’t want anything about this to change or become too complicated or intruded upon.\" ‌ She admitted to fans in 2017 that her loved up song Gorgeous was about A Christmas Carol star Joe, and pal Ed Sheeran corroborated this before calling Joe a \"really friendly, really good dude\". Holiday snaps Taylor and Joe posted on their separate accounts in the exact same spot in the desert confirmed they were travelling together in 2018, and Taylor urged her fans to go and watch Joe's film The Favourite in the cinema. The following year, Taylor and Joe were much more relaxed about regularly being papped together and her song London Boy was thought to be about the North London-based actor. ‌ Rumours soon began to swirl that the couple were engaged, with a source telling US Weekly: \"Joe wants to marry [Taylor] and she wants to marry him. He’s just waiting to find the perfect time to propose. He wants to make it unforgettable and extremely special. \"Taylor’s friends are all talking about a proposal and how she really wants to marry Joe. He’s her dream guy.\" Content cannot be displayed without consent ‌ And many of her fans are currently convinced that Joe and Taylor have actually secretly tied the knot. Internet sleuths dedicated to studying Taylor's every move have spotted hints they are married or at least engaged, including when Taylor released her song ME! in April 2019, and she confirmed to fans: \"There’s a secret in the video I’ve been keeping for months - let’s see who can guess it.\" In the video, Taylor can be seen with a big rock on her engagement ring finger, and viewers wondered if that was her way of announcing the special news - thought others thought she was announcing she'd adopted the cat who made a cameo. ‌ She was also spotted wearing the same ring in her documentary, Miss Americana. \"I low key think T", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/hints-taylor-swift-secretly-married-25441125", "domain": "mirror.co.uk", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 7538}, {"source_number": 8, "title": "GB News Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift fans think duo have secretly married as post online goes viral", "snippet": "June 10, 2025 - Taylor Swift fans are speculating that the pop star may have secretly married her boyfriend Travis Kelce after a wedding invitation emerged showing them listed under the same surname.", "full_content": "WATCH NOW: Travis Kelce laughs at Taylor Swift's singing The duo have been dating for two years, with talk of the pair getting hitched continuing to rumble on Taylor Swift fans are speculating that the pop star may have secretly married her boyfriend Travis Kelce after a wedding invitation emerged showing them listed under the same surname. The invitation, which has circulated on social media over the past week, was addressed to \"Taylor and Travis Kelce\" for a Chicago Bears player's wedding they recently attended. The shared surname on the invitation has sent Swift's devoted fanbase into a frenzy, with many wondering whether this could be evidence that the couple have tied the knot without public knowledge. Swift, who wrapped up her record-breaking Eras Tour in December, has not been seen at a public event since February's Super Bowl. Taylor Swift fans are speculating that the pop star may have secretly married her boyfriend Travis Kelce after a wedding invitation emerged showing them listed under the same surname The invitation was shared on Instagram by wedding planner Ellie Nottoli, who posted a photograph showing the couple's placement at table 13 - a nod to Swift's favourite number. The wedding, between Chicago Bears player Cole Kmet and Emily Jarosz, saw Swift wearing a blue strapless Markarian dress whilst posing for photographs with other guests alongside Kelce. Nottoli's Instagram story featuring the invitation has become the focal point of speculation, with the \"Taylor and Travis Kelce\" wording prompting widespread discussion across social media platforms.

There has been no official confirmation from either Swift or Kelce regarding their marital status. Despite the ongoing speculation, Swift's fans appear united on one particular issue regarding any potential future nuptials.

The image, which went viral, was from the nuptials of Chicago Bears player Cole Kmet and Emily Jarosz last Saturday. Event planner Ellie Nottoli shared the photo, revealing an invite that named \"Taylor and Travis Kelce \" at Table 13 - Taylor's lucky number. Notably absent from the invite was Swift's surname, sparking intense fan speculation. Ellie's post added fuel to the fire by mentioning: \"We all know Taylor and Travis were at a different wedding in Tennessee.

Meanwhile, another simply queried, \"'They got married ?\" ‌ However, not everyone was convinced. One fan suggested that the omission of Taylor's last name was merely for the \"aesthetic\". Another chimed in, saying if they were indeed married, it should technically be \"'Technically it should be Travis and Taylor Kelce.\" The couple first made their relationship public in 2023. Since then, they've been a solid team, often spotted at games and concerts whenever their hectic schedules permit. ‌ They even shared a sweet Super Bowl smooch that left fans swooning, and Travis has been seen joining Taylor on stage during her Eras Tour. Before they officially became a couple, Travis revealed on his podcast \"New Heights,\" that he attempted to give Swift his number through a friendship bracelet at one of her concerts, only to find out she doesn't speak before or after performances to preserve her voice. But fate gave him another shot, and his persistence paid off, leaving Swift impressed. Fans went into a frenzy in November of the same year when Taylor tweaked the lyrics of \"Karma\" during a concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She changed the line from \"Karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me\" to \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.\" ‌ The singer was later seen rushing over to her beau for a passionate kiss. The couple's public displays of affection escalated over the following months, culminating in a 2024 selfie featuring Taylor, Travis, Prince William, and his two eldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at her London concert. This marked the NFL star's first official appearance on her Instagram feed. Their relationship has only grown stronger since then, and the latest rumors of an engagement have Swifties worldwide eagerly awaiting confirmation.

Though, for what it’s worth, Travis and Taylor are still going strong—and have been spending a ton of quality time together in Florida. In fact, a source told Us Weekly earlier this month that Taylor “is trying to spend as much time with him as she can by going to Boca. They are doing stuff separately out of necessity because of his training, but when they find time to connect, it’s intentional and meaningful.” Meanwhile another insider added, “Florida has been the perfect escape for them.

Taylor Swift may have left her London Boy behind, but when you’re arguably the most famous woman in the world, is there really anywhere better for a night out than the Big Smoke? Back in New York , the princess of pop is often crossing paths with, well, princesses – Beatrice and Taylor are known purveyors of private members’ club Zero Bond in Lower Manhattan – but god, she loves the English. The chatelaine of the high-society squad, Swift has been rubbing circles with the great, the good, and the glamorous of Britain’s glitterati all from the comfort of their natural habitat. From backstage at the Playhouse Theatre with Cara Delevingne to clandestine getaways to Chiltern Firehouse with her latest muse, here’s all the places Taylor Swift has been spotted in the capital.

In the June 2024 issue, Plum Sykes unveiled everything you need to know about the different tribes By Plum Sykes So enamoured with London was the songstress that she brought her record-breaking Eras Tour back to the city for round two. Where to kick off the billion-dollar festivities? It was only ever going to be Annabel’s. The Mayfair members’ clubs played host to over 200 of Swift’s concert crew, who partied alongside the star at the only nightclub ever frequented by the late Queen Elizabeth. Reportedly, drinks were on a Vivienne-Westwood-clad Taylor at this most hedonistic of hideaways, and when the embers of the night finally died down at 3am (no vocal rest for this Grammy winner), it’s said she organised private coaches to bus her partygoers back to their London abodes. It beats an early morning Uber. The Rose Room Bar of Annabel's, where Taylor Swift recently hosted a 200-strong thank you party for her Eras Tour entourage Peter Dazeley/Getty Images Swift’s love of that most storied British institution, the private members’ club, stretches all the way back to 2013, when eagle-eyed fans were convinced they caught her on a date with singer Tom Odell at the Groucho Club in Soho , and in 2021 she was on the guest list when Lena Dunham tied the knot with Luis Felber at the Union Club – Swift has long been close to the Girls writer, and was invited to London as a bridesmaid. The summer wasn't even the first time Taylor Swift has been spotted at Annabel’s. Back when she was with Joe Alwyn, the pair found time to rest what must have been very weary legs at the members’ club for Vogue ’s BAFTA afterparty in 2019. She dodged the Grammys for the celebration of British acting talent – no wonder she’s become a darling of the West End scene. Of course, when it comes to bagging front row tickets for the hottest shows in town, it helps to be best friends with the leading lady. Swift swung by the Kit Kat Club to watch supermodel chum Cara Delevingne tread the boards as Sally Bowles in Cabaret earlier this year. The pair have been thick as thieves since Delevingne’s runway days, sharing the runway during the 2013 Victoria ’s Secret show and accompanying each other to Super Bowls and secret dinner parties ever since.

A fashion icon in her own right, she was a muse for Giorgio Armani , and, during her career with the art dealer Karsten Schubert in the late ‘80s, she was credited with discovering the artists Rachael Whitread and Gary Hume. She has been married to the gallerist Timothy Taylor since 1992, and the pair share four children: Columbus, Eloise, Estella, and Cassius. Both sons have followed in their parents' artistic footsteps. Columbus is employed at his father’s gallery, while Cassius, who joined his mother at Frieze, works as an events consultant and DJ, and has often been billed as the ‘bad boy of the royal family’.

The daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York , wore a classically elegant look for the preview, donning a high-waisted pleated midi skirt and sharp black jumper, which she paired with her beloved Sophie Lis disco mushroom earrings and a burgundy shoulder bag by Chloé Faye. No doubt royal watchers will be happy to see Lady Helen Taylor on such good form following her mother’s funeral. Lady Helen made such a poignant tribute to her late mother at the Catholic service, which was held at Westminster Cathedral in September, wearing the Duchess’s sparkling sapphire, diamond, and platinum engagement ring. The beautiful band, which had first been seen when the Duke and Duchess announced their engagement in March 1961, bore a striking resemblance to the engagement ring worn by Katherine’s mother-in-law, Princess Marina. Lady Helen Taylor accompanied her father to the funeral of the Duchess of Kent in September Wiktor Szymanowicz/Getty Images That Lady Helen Taylor chose the special piece to honour her mother was just one of many touching moments on a day that saw the royal family gather to mourn the Duchess of Kent. Katherine’s coffin was transported from Kensington Palace to the Cathedral on 15 September for the Rite of Reception and Vespers, before the Requiem Mass the following day. In a sure sign of how treasured the Duchess was by the royal family, her coffin was driven by the Royal Hearse, which had been designed by the late Queen Elizabeth, and was draped in the Royal Standard.

The rumors began circulating when, perPage Six,Ellie Nottoli,the event planner for Chicago Bears playerCole Kmet'swedding, mentioned that Kelce and Swift were on the guest list for the ceremony. During a reveal on her Instagram Story, Nottoli showcased some of the personalized details of Kmet's wedding toEmily Jarosz, including a letter addressed to \"Taylor and Travis Kelce\" written in beautiful calligraphy. This particular mention caught the attention of many, as fans are interpreting it as a sign that the couple had already exchanged vows and thatTayloris now a Kelce. The excitement was palpable, with one fan exclaiming, \"TAYLOR AND TRAVIS KELCE!????? EXCUSE [sic] ME!\" However, while fans were eager to connect the dots, not everyone was convinced by the \"married\" implication. Some pointed out that it is common for couples, married or not, to share names on wedding invitations and gifts for aesthetic purposes. Comments flooded in, with one person remarking, \"Me and my bf do that too on gifts and stuff even though we aren't married, it's just kinda for the aesthetic.\" Another chimed in, questioning the order of the names: \"Technically it should be Travis and Taylor Kelce.\" Interestingly, Kelce and Swift were not in attendance at Kmet's wedding on Saturday. Instead, the couple had celebrated at Kelce's cousinTanner Corum'swedding the previous day in Knoxville, Tennessee. Photos from that event showed Swift glowing in a stunning blue floral dress while Kelce kept it casual in a quarter-sleeved shirt and slacks. This flurry of wedding rumors follows whispers from insiders suggesting Kelce might be considering popping the question to Swift soon. A source told the Daily Mail that once Kelce wraps up his upcoming NFL season, there will be serious conversations about taking their relationship to the next level. The source expressed confidence, stating, \"Everyone is just waiting for Travis to ask her parents for her hand in marriage... Nothing seems to be imminent, but it will 100 percent happen.\" Numerous Swifties turned to social media to speculate whether the 35-year-old singer is pregnant with her first child with NFL tight endTravis Kelce. Fans noticed that the shade of the car matched the color of the front tires, leading them to suggest that Swift might be hinting at a new baby bump. One fan commented, “I thought Travis Kelce was becoming a dad for a sec,” which sparked a flurry of online theories and hopes about a potential Swift-Kelce baby. Another fan remarked,“Oh it does look like that.” One X user posted: “Oh wow that did take a minute [crying-laughing emoji].” Many other social media users confessed that they experienced similar feelings upon seeing the picture. In reality, the visual illusion did not depict a baby bump, and it is believed that Swift is not pregnant. Nevertheless, this is not the first occasion this year that Swifties have generated speculation regarding a possible pregnancy for the ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ singer. © ¡HOLA!

As the world turns its attention to the Oasis reunion, Glasto and the ’90s revival, things are heating up. But if music be the food of love… well, that would explain why the whole world has fallen hard for Brit boys . Netflix is cashing in, with Lena Dunham’s Too Much – about a heartbroken New Yorker who finds new love in London – hitting screens this week. It’s loosely inspired by her time in the British capital, and produced by Working Title (the team behind Bridget Jones , Notting Hill and Love Actually ). Similarly, My Oxford Year , which sees an American student fall hard among the city ’s dreaming spires, is slated for release on Netflix later this summer. Instagram content Or one could just ask Olivia Rodrigo, who headlined BST Hyde Park with her British beau in the audience. ‘I wrote this song at this time I was really, really crushing on this boy from London ,’ she spoke to the crowd as she introduced her first love song, ‘So American’, written for Enola Holmes actor Louis Partridge. A week later, they put on a loved up display in Wimbledon ’s royal box. And it's not just Olivia; look to Haim, who enlisted Brits Will Poulter, Archie Madekwe and Nabhaan Rizwan as swoon-worthy love interests in their new music video for ‘All Over Me’. So, why the sudden popularity? Undeniably, we have charm, we have wit, and – as Rodrigo says – we have those ‘little sweets you get from M&S’ (who doesn’t love a Percy Pig?). But what set the trend? After all, for a moment there, London boys lost their international appeal. When Taylor Swift ended things with Joe Alwyn, packed her bags and sang ‘So Long, London’, it marked the end of the better part of a decade spent in the company of one British beau or another (before Alwyn, there was Tom Hiddleston and Harry Styles). Did trading in life in Hampstead for the all-American Travis Kelce mean the world had moved on from crushing on Brit boys? It had been some length of time since the heartthrobs of One Direction had gone their separate ways, with anyone else yet to fill the void. And Princes William and Harry were quickly ageing out of being internationally crushed upon, with no other eligible, young, British men in the Royal Family for fans to turn their attention to.

Tatler explores her impressive life of service By Ben Jureidini There was, of course, in the golden era of Britpop, a time when the Brits were untouchable as Hollywood’s favourite leading men. Hugh Grant starred in Notting Hill and Bridget Jones – also featuring Colin Firth, who additionally cemented his role as the quintessential Brit in Love Actually and What a Girl Wants . Then there’s Jude Law, who melted hearts in The Holiday . Concurrently, Britpop saw Take That setting hearts ablaze on stage. It’s undeniable that there’s been a revival. That may be thanks to some high-profile transatlantic relationships as of late. Zendaya, who confirmed her engagement to Tom Holland in January, has swapped New York for New Maldon Waitrose. Sabrina Dhowre has been married to Idris Elba since 2019 – who, coincidentally, is featured at the start of Taylor Swift’s ‘London Boy’. And former Tatler cover star Nicola Peltz is going strong with Britpop-scion Brooklyn Beckham, three years after their lavish Palm Beach wedding. But no one’s falling for a Brit boy grabbed the world’s attention quite like the Duchess of Sussex . And it seems the actress turned lifestyle guru may have had a type for some time: long before her engagement to Prince Harry was announced, Meghan Markle told Esquire that she ‘loves how British guys dress for the cold’. It seems she may have fallen for a spell of Richard-Curtis- style winter romance too, saying: ‘There's something so romantic about a man in a scarf and a knitted hat.’ Sounds like someone had been watching The Holiday… Tom Holland and Zendaya – pictured here leaving Holland's performance of Romeo and Juliet , directed by Jamie Lloyd – have swapped New York for New Maldon Waitrose; after all, Holland was born in Kingston-upon-Thames Ricky Vigil M / Justin E Palmer Read More Who is the Earl of St Andrews?

The couple got engaged after being together for five years, sources told Life & Style Thursday. Their engagement rumors started circulating last month when the 32-year-old singer and her boyfriend traveled to Cornwall, in his native England, for a romantic three-day trip. The Grammy winner has written many songs that were supposedly about Alwyn, but the two have mostly been silent about their relationship since it started in 2016, reported New York Daily News . Earlier this month, while promoting his new \"Conversations With Friends,\" in which Alwyn’s character is in an open relationship, he said that people can do whatever they want that \"makes them happy.\" As for him, he is \"obviously happy in a monogamous relationship.\" Swift also spoke about him early last year when one of her two 2020 albums, “Folklore,” won the Grammy for album of the year. Swift said in her acceptance speech that Alwyn, who is the \"first person that I play every single song that I write, and I had the best time writing songs with you in quarantine.\" A source recently told Entertainment Tonight that Swift and the actor “are very happy in their relationship,” even though they like to “keep their private life private.” The source shared that the two have been enjoying their time as a couple, and they have \"spoken about their future together and feel very secure about their relationship.” Both the celebrities lead busy lives because of their successful careers, but it's not a problem for them. The source said that they're supportive of \"each other's careers and of each other in general.\" The insider added that they have been busy with work and they \"completely understand how to balance hectic schedules and still make time for each other.\" The source thinks it's \"part of why their relationship really works.” Their engagement news came in after actor Jake Gyllenhaal broke his almost decade-long silence about Swift’s break-up song, “All Too Well.\" Gyllenhaal and Swift had a brief relationship in 2010, and though the singer has never confirmed that the actor inspired the song, she’s never denied fans’ suspicions. Gyllenhaal said that the song “has nothing to do with me” and “is her expression” as an artist. But he also believes that “it’s important when supporters get unruly that we feel a responsibility to have them be civil and not allow for cyberbullying in one’s name.\" Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn are seen at Zuma restaurant on October 6, 2019 in New York City.

The photo in question was posted by Ellie Nottoli, the event planner for the wedding of Chicago Bears tight end Cole Kmet and his partner Emily Jarosz. She was sharing a bunch of photos from the event, the blue invite envelope being one of them. It immediately ignited a discourse on the internet. “That’s usually standard for weddings i believe,” quipped one commenter against the rumor. Another argued: “This is not common for unmarried couples. I have been invited to many weddings with my partner and each of our full names are on the invitation.

The mom and dad of the international pop sensation, who just announced a new album called “The Life of a Showgirl,” could be coined as the first “Swifties,” believing in their daughter’s talent from Day 1. The couple moved to Nashville more than two decades ago to help their gifted daughter, a teenager at the time, navigate the country music industry. The “Karma” singer has often spoken about how her family’s love has guided her, and she’s thanked them for the sacrifices they’ve made for her career. After winning top new female vocalist at the 2008 Academy of Country Music Awards , Taylor Swift said, “There are so many people that deserve to be thanked for this,” but she dedicated her acceptance speech to just one: her mom. “And that’s the person that used to love to go to lunch with her friends and cook dinner for her family and sleep in her bed every night, and she gave that all away and left it all behind to go on the road with her 16-year-old daughter,” Taylor Swift said during the speech, in part. “And so, Mom, thank you so much. I love you. This is for you.” As Taylor Swift’s success as a crossover artist took on a life of its own, her parents have continued to support her along the way. Scott and Andrea Swift have been spotted singing along at their daughter's concerts, interacting with her devoted fan base and, as of the past couple years, attending NFL games to support Taylor Swift’s now-fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . On Aug. 26, 2025, their daughter hit a major milestone in her relationship with Kelce. The two announced their engagement in a joint post on Instagram. While the NFL and staunch fans alike reacted within minutes to the news, both Taylor Swift's parents and the football star's parents, Ed and Donna Kelce , have yet to share their reaction. More than 16 years later, Taylor Swift continues to gush about her family. Read on to learn more about Taylor Swift's parents. Who Are Scott and Andrea Swift? Andrea and Scott Swift tied the knot in 1988, about a year before their daughter was born. They welcomed Taylor Swift on Dec. 13, 1989 — a date significant to many Swifties as 13 is the singer’s lucky number and her fifth album is named “1989.” In 1992, the couple welcomed Taylor Swift’s younger brother, Austin . Andrea Swift is the daughter of American opera singer Marjorie Finlay and spent some time growing up in Singapore, Taylor Swift revealed during her March 2 “Eras Tour” show in Singapore. “So a lot of the time when we’d come here on tour, my mom would take me and drive me past her old house, where she used to go to school. So, I’ve been hearing about Singapore my whole life,” she said during the show . “Mama Swift,” as Swifties know her, is frequently seen by her daughter's side at concerts and other events, where she is friendly with fans. She's often her daughter’s guest at award shows . The pop star's relationship with her mom is shown in a heartwarming compilation of images and videos from her childhood in the official video for her song \"The Best Day (Taylor's Version).\" Taylor Swift allows fans a ra re glimpse at family photos , touching on her relationship with her mother from the age of 5 until her young adult years. “You’re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world,” she sings on the song. “I love you for giving me your eyes.” In the song, Taylor Swift also mentions her love for her father. “I have an excellent father,” she sings. “His strength is making me stronger.” Scott Swift has worked as a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch and later established Swift Group. Though he’s clearly got a head for business, the proud dad also likes to let less, as evidenced in a playful TikTok video of him riding a Segway that his daughter posted during her “Eras Tour.” Taylor Swift also frequently alludes to her maternal grandmother, who passed away in 2003, and her impact on her singing career, dedicating her track “Marjorie” to her grandmother on the album “Evermore.” They Moved From Pennsylvania to Tennessee Taylor Swift shared another compilation of family images and videos in her official video for the 2019 holiday tune “Christmas Tree Farm.” Taylor Swift alludes in the song to the Christmas tree farm where she was raised. The singer and her brother were both born in Reading, Pennsylvania, and in 2003, their parents moved the whole family to Nashville to support Swift's singing career. “At 13, I was offered a development deal by a major record label,” Taylor Swift told Time in 2014. “My parents gave in and we moved from Pennsylvania (to Nashville).” After Taylor Swift announced the release of “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” in Nashville during “The Eras Tour,” she reflected on how she felt when first writing the album between the ages of 18 and 20 w", "url": "https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/taylor-swift-parents-scott-andrea-swift-rcna118462", "domain": "today.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 3, "title": "ELLE Taylor Swift Opens Up About Spending 'The Life of a Showgirl' Release Week With Her Parents", "snippet": "3 weeks ago - In July 2025, TMZ revealed that Scott had undergone quintuple bypass surgery over a month ago, and Taylor was by his side during the heart procedure and recovery period, along with her brother, Austin, and mom, Andrea .", "full_content": "Taylor Swift has risen to wild levels of fame, especially with her incredibly successful Eras Tour. While the pop star certainly deserves most of the credit, her parents have undeniably been the wind beneath her wings throughout her career. Scott and Andrea Swift recognized their daughter’s talent early and supported her in all her pursuits. “She was always singing music when she was 3, 5, 6, 7, years old,” Scott told University of Delaware’s paper UDaily . “It’s Taylor doing what she likes to do.” Not every dad would notice their kid likes to sing and go the extra mile to help them follow their dreams, but Scott did. And Andrea was right beside them both. Here’s everything to know about the couple behind the star. Jump to: Who are Scott and Andrea Swift? How did Scott and Andrea encourage Taylor Swift when she was a kid? How are Andrea and Scott involved in Taylor Swift’s life now? They both like Taylor’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Andrea joined Taylor and Travis Kelce’s Mom, Donna Kelce, on a game night in November 2024. The mom and daughter duo shared a sweet moment after her Toronto Eras Tour show. They shared a special moment with Travis Kelce’s mother, Donna Kelce, in December. Scott underwent quintuple bypass surgery in 2025 but is doing great now. Taylor shared more about her parents’ health in August 2025. Kelce asked for their blessing before proposing to Swift. Swift said her parents joined her for The Life of a Showgirl album release week. Who are Scott and Andrea Swift? Aside from being parents to one of the world's biggest stars? Andrea worked as a marketing manager at an advertising agency, while Scott was a stockbroker who eventually served as vice president for Merrill Lynch. They were married on Feb. 20, 1988, in Texas. Taylor was born on Dec. 13, 1989, and her younger brother, Austin, arrived on March 11, 1992. As business-minded people, they likely weren’t expecting such a creative kid. Her mom, at least, was thinking of a future where her daughter worked in business and named her to help protect her from gender discrimination. Taylor told Rolling Stone in 2009, “My mom thought it was cool that if you got a business card that said ‘Taylor,’ you wouldn’t know if it was a guy or a girl...She wanted me to be a business person in a business world.” They are also both cancer survivors. In a Tumblr post in 2015, Taylor shared that Andrea had been diagnosed with the disease. She kept the specifics private but added, “She wanted you to know. She wanted you to know why she may not be at as many shows this tour. She’s got an important battle to fight.” In an essay for ELLE in 2019, Taylor said Andrea’s cancer had returned and revealed that Scott had also undergone treatment for cancer. The family have kept further medical details understandably private. How did Scott and Andrea encourage Taylor Swift when she was a kid? Swift has talked a lot about how she grew up on a Christmas tree farm in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, which is not a place with a million opportunities to sing. They made sure to shuttle her to local gigs and karaoke nights to start. View full post on Instagram They eventually moved to Hendersonville, the suburbs of Nashville, for more opportunities. To get some attention, the family started passing out tapes of Taylor singing karaoke. “My mom waited in the car with my little brother while I knocked on doors up and down Music Row,” Taylor told Entertainment Weekly in 2008. “I would say, ‘Hi, I'm Taylor. I’m 11. I wanted a record deal—call me.’” She did land a record deal with Sony when she was only 14. Despite Taylor’s youth, Andrea told Entertainment Weekly that she never pressured her daughter into anything. “There would always be an escape hatch into normal life if she decided this wasn’t something she had to pursue,” Andrea said in the 2008 interview. “And of course that’s like saying to her, ‘If you want to stop breathing, that’s cool.’” They also tried not to frame the move to Nashville as being exclusively for Taylor. “I never wanted to make that move about her ‘making it,’” Andrea told EW . “Because what a horrible thing if it hadn’t happened, for her to carry that kind of guilt or pressure around...And we moved far enough outside Nashville to where she didn’t have to be going to school with producers’ kids and label presidents’ kids and be reminded constantly that she was struggling to make it...We’ve always told her that this is not about putting food on our table or making our dreams come true.” But after Taylor made her debut at the Grand Ole Opry in September 2006, Andrea was the one who went on the tour with her daughter. When Taylor won her first Grammy Awards for her album Fearless , Taylor dedicated the award to her parents. “This is for all those times that you said I could do whatever I wanted in life,” she said. “And my mom, you’re my best friend.” How are Andrea and Scott involved in Taylor Swift’s life now?

The Rose Room Bar of Annabel's, where Taylor Swift recently hosted a 200-strong thank you party for her Eras Tour entourage Peter Dazeley/Getty Images Swift’s love of that most storied British institution, the private members’ club, stretches all the way back to 2013, when eagle-eyed fans were convinced they caught her on a date with singer Tom Odell at the Groucho Club in Soho , and in 2021 she was on the guest list when Lena Dunham tied the knot with Luis Felber at the Union Club – Swift has long been close to the Girls writer, and was invited to London as a bridesmaid. The summer wasn't even the first time Taylor Swift has been spotted at Annabel’s. Back when she was with Joe Alwyn, the pair found time to rest what must have been very weary legs at the members’ club for Vogue ’s BAFTA afterparty in 2019. She dodged the Grammys for the celebration of British acting talent – no wonder she’s become a darling of the West End scene. Of course, when it comes to bagging front row tickets for the hottest shows in town, it helps to be best friends with the leading lady. Swift swung by the Kit Kat Club to watch supermodel chum Cara Delevingne tread the boards as Sally Bowles in Cabaret earlier this year. The pair have been thick as thieves since Delevingne’s runway days, sharing the runway during the 2013 Victoria ’s Secret show and accompanying each other to Super Bowls and secret dinner parties ever since.

By Brandon Bombay Aug. 14, 2025 1:32 pm EST Kevin Winter/acma/Getty Images During her headline-making appearance on the \"New Heights\" podcast, Taylor Swift provided an update on her parents' health, including her mom Andrea Swift's cancer diagnosis . Speaking to her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce, the \"Bad Blood\" singer mentioned that her father, Scott Swift, had undergone quintuple bypass surgery. \"My dad's like, 'New arteries, new me,'\" Taylor said. Her father wasn't the only parent undergoing recent rehab. \"My mom got a new knee,\" the pop star added. The encouraging news was how Andrea had handled the physical setback. \"So she's doing great,\" Taylor added. \"She's scampering around. Well, not quite at scampering yet, but she's doing great.\" Even though the \"Shake It Off\" artist didn't offer a full update on Andrea's status with cancer, all signs pointed to her mother doing well, as Taylor said she expects both of her parents to live long lives. \"This was just like the summer of my parental upgrades,\" she told the Kelce brothers. \"Making sure that they live to be at least 186 years old.\" The tragic truth is that both of Taylor's parents have had cancer. In January 2020, Taylor opened up about her mother's condition. \"While she was going through treatment, they found a brain tumor,\" she told Variety at the time, adding that it had been the most challenging health issue the Swift family had faced. Fortunately, besides Taylor saying her mother was \"doing great\" on the podcast, there have been other signs that Andrea may be out of the woods. How Andrea Swift has been offering Taylor Swift support Kevin Mazur/ama2010/Getty Images Taylor Swift also mentioned Andrea Swift on the \"New Heights\" podcast when she spoke about getting her masters back from Scooter Braun. The \"Down Bad\" singer said her mom and brother, Austin Swift, were instrumental in the process. \"Rather than send lawyers or management in a big crew, I sent my mom and my brother, who I work with, to L.A,\" Taylor told Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce. In fact, Taylor was spending time with her beau when her mom gave her a major update on recovering the masters. \"It was a couple of months after the Super Bowl. We're in Kansas City, and I get a call from my mom and she's like, 'You got your music,'\" the singer said while getting emotional. That wasn't the only feel-good moment she shared with her mom. In November 2024, a candid video caught what Taylor's relationship with her parents is really like . Amateur footage showed her exchanging a sweet embrace with Andrea after a show in Toronto during her Eras Tour. Andrea was waiting for her daughter backstage after the performance and gave her a motherly hug that included a quick back rub. Fans were moved when a clip of the familial moment was shared on X . \"She's exhausted, mama is giving her the serene medicine of love,\" one fan wrote .

Additionally, in January 2020, the “Bad Blood” singer revealed her mother was battling a brain tumor that was found amid chemotherapy treatments. Andrea Swift, 66, and her 72-year-old husband Scott Kingsley Swift, were praised by fans this weekend after giving out friendship bracelets to fans at Wembley Stadium in London. Facing cancer as a parent can be a challenging task. But having children who depend on you can also provide another reason to fight the disease with everything you’ve got. “Bad Blood” singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, 34, who is set to finish up the European portion of her Eras Tour performances at London’s Wembley Stadium on Tuesday, has not only continued to win over the hearts of her fans, but her parents have too. After a recent show, her 66-year-old mom Andrea Swift and 72-year-old dad Scott Kingsley Swift, were praised by a fan as “lovely, down-to-earth” people after they were seen giving out friendship bracelets as gifts to Swifties in the audience during her recent shows at Wembley.

Andrea was seen, donning sunglasses and black dress, with her hair down, interacting with dozens of fans alongside her husband. Fans commented on the video, “What lovely, down-to-earth people!” and “Taylor joys and happiness is to see her parents always together and their amazing support.” While a third wrote, “The bodygurds are amazing to protect mama SWIFT.” Other footage, shared on TikTok , showed her parents in the crowd after she sang “Champaign Problems,” which prompted a standing ovation. Swift is heard telling the audience, “I guarantee my parents were just recording that on their phones. “So anytime I’m having a very sad or bad day from now on, not only will I play the video in my mind, but I’m gonna revisit that moment a lot.

So it’s just been a really hard time for us as a family,” Taylor Swift told Variety in an earlier interview. The specifics about Andrea’s breast cancer and the status of her ongoing treatment remain unknown, but one thing is for sure — she’s not letting her previous cancer diagnoses prevent her from taking part in their daughter’s eventful life. Although the “Anti-Hero” singer hasn’t revealed explicit details about her mom’s diagnosis, it’s important to understand that metastatic breast cancer often presents as a recurrence of a prior early-stage breast cancer, although it can be a new diagnosis.

Scroll down for everything true fans have to know when it comes to all the most vital facts about Taylor Swift’s parents. Taylor Swift’s parents got married in Houston, Texas. Scott and Andrea Swift’s love story started in Houston, Texas (which also happens to be where Andrea is from), where they tied the knot on February 20, 1988. Taylor referenced the important role Houston played in her family’s history while giving her parents a shout-out during her Eras Tour show in the city in April 2023. View full post on TikTok “I love you, Houston,” Tay told the crowd in a speech that was shared all over TikTok. “You treat us like Houston is my mom’s hometown, which it is. You treat us like this is where my parents got married, which it is.” On December 13, 1989 (aka roughly nine months after the couple would have been celebrating their one-year wedding anniversary—we see you, Scott + Andrea 😏), Taylor was born, and a little more than two years later, the fourth member of the Swift fam, Taylor’s younger brother Austin , was born on March 11, 1992. But they relocated to Pennsylvania to start their family/own a Christmas tree farm. Instagram One of the most “omg, that’s almost too adorable/on brand to be true” details in Taylor Swift’s bio is the fact that she spent her early years being raised on a literal Christmas tree farm. After tying the knot in Texas, Scott and Andrea settled in Reading, Pennsylvania, where they purchased the 11-acre Pine Ridge Farm (“pine” as in Christmas trees, of course) and raised Taylor and Austin for several years before the family ultimately moved to the Nashville area to support Taylor’s country music dreams. Meaning: this instant holiday classic is actually biographical. View full post on YouTube Taylor Swift’s parents relocated the family to the Nashville area when she was 14. In 2003, when Taylor was 14, Scott and Andrea decided to move the family to Nashville to help their daughter pursue her music career after she signed a deal with Sony/ATV Publishing (becoming the youngest person ever to do so—NBD). Instead of moving to the city of Nashville, however, Scott and Andrea opted to buy a home in Hendersonville, a suburb about 20 miles outside of Nashville, to help minimize any pressure Taylor might feel about the move. “I never wanted to make that move about her ‘making it,’” Andrea explained to Entertainment Weekly in 2008. “Because what a horrible thing if it hadn’t happened, for her to carry that kind of guilt or pressure around. And we moved far enough outside Nashville to where she didn’t have to be going to school with producers’ kids and label presidents’ kids and be reminded constantly that she was struggling to make it. We’ve always told her that this is not about putting food on our table or making our dreams come true.” Of course, Taylor one hundred percent knew what was behind the move anyway (not that “making it” turned out to be an issue, of course). “I knew I was the reason they were moving,” Taylor eventually told Self (per E! Online ) . “But they tried to put no pressure on me. They were like, ‘Well, we need a change of scenery anyway’ and ‘I love how friendly the people in Tennessee are.’” Taylor’s parents both worked in finance. Before they were full-time supportive parents to one of the world’s biggest pop stars, Scott and Andrea Swift both worked in finance, Scott as a stockbroker (and later as a vice president for Merrill Lynch) and Andrea as a marketing manager at an advertising agency. And for the record, both of Taylor’s parents have been able to put their professional skills to work helping her with her career over the years. While Scott has been shown to play a key role in her business management team (see: his appearance in her documentary Miss Americana ), Andrea’s marketing skills were especially helpful during the early days of Taylor’s career, back when there were still people who weren’t fully aware of her yet. “The parents already had her Myspace and her website up and running,” Taylor’s manager Rick Barker said in 2008. “The mom and dad both have great marketing minds. I don’t want to say fake it until you make it, but when you looked at her stuff, it was very professional even before she got her deal.” Both her parents have battled cancer. Over the years, both Scott and Andrea Swift have faced health issues.

In: Living 4 Minute Read By Krissy Dieruf Share Krissy Dieruf I’ve been in a lavender haze since attending Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in Minneapolis with my daughter. To call it magical is an understatement. Holy feels like too much, but it’s not. The lights, costumes, dances, perfectly-timed winks into the big screen, secret cues and clues, glowing bracelets, stage dive and long swim, adoring fans, the dedications to strangers posting about late brothers on Twitter, and gratitude for people showing up (as if we wouldn’t), wrapped every single person in her bejeweled embrace. Taylor Swift has built her success flawlessly, and it’s awe-inspiring. It’s also hard-fought, with years of others trying to hold her back, knock her down, insult, criticize, scandalize, and minimize her intelligence, creativity, and unyielding persistence. She has somehow cut through the haters and shaken off the bad blood with superpower moves to become what some hail as the best songwriter, artist, and performer of all time. And while she sings openly about relationships that have come and gone, one person is steadfastly by her side—her mom. Andrea Swift was seen at the Minneapolis Eras show on Friday night handing out hot dogs to fans, and my teenage neighbor took a picture with her. Andrea is smiling big, her arm wrapped around my neighbor’s shoulders, the epitome of a soccer mom who knows every kid on the team’s name as she walks the sidelines, ensuring everyone has water and snacks while cheering for hours. Except she’s a rockstar’s mom, and her kid is the number one player on the field. RELATED: Dear Meghan’s Mom, What’s It Like To Watch Your Princess Become One? I can only imagine what it’s like to stand on a stadium floor watching your daughter sing and dance and dazzle 60,000 people night after night. And I can’t fathom the struggles and minefields she’s had to help Taylor navigate. Since her daughter was fourteen, Andrea Swift has been supporting Taylor’s journey to making her dreams come true, and well, we can all see how that’s turned out. As a mom, I struggle daily to help my kid make good choices, but they usually range from when to go to bed and what not to eat to avoid a sugar coma—obviously, not quite the scale of Taylor’s life decisions. When faced with a complicated issue with one of my kids recently, though, I found myself asking what would Taylor’s mom do? I pondered for a while and it got me thinking about how she raised one of the most influential, positive, kind, creative, powerful, intelligent, fearless, confident, humble, gracious, and successful women of all time. So, Andrea, if you ever feel like writing a book, or even a short article, or you know, chatting on the phone for a few minutes because you seem like the kind of person who would be fun to talk to, here are some serious parenting questions I have for you: How do you help kids navigate bullies and people who throw rocks at things that shine? How do you handle a fearless kid and balance letting them make their own choices? Do you have any sayings or mottos that helped you parent over the years? How do you handle it when your kid hangs out with people you know are not good for them (cough cough, Dear John )? How do you navigate arguments with tweens/teenagers? And how do you make up? Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently as a mom? Is there anything you would have done more or less? What is the key to staying humble? What would Taylor say is her favorite thing about you as a mom? And as a woman? What is the most important thing for moms to remember as their kids enter the world as young adults? What do you do when you’re feeling worried or anxious about your kids? What advice have you given Taylor over the years? How do you handle it if she ignores your advice? How do you motivate kids to work hard and push themselves, or must they be self-driven? If you had to narrow it down, what is your favorite thing about being a mom? I hope that’s not too many. I probably have more. But I’ll stop there for now. RELATED: The Sacred Bond Between Mother and Daughter Beyond all of Taylor Swift’s professional success, she is deeply kind and thoughtful, humble and generous, gracious and in tune with the hearts of the world.

Later,Aliarecalled her initial reaction in a conversation with her sister-in-law and actor Kareena Kapoor Khan, saying: “There was this one moment before the Christmas lunch where we were driving, and it was random where Ranbir said, ‘Listen, should we take a picture with Raha, today?” I was like, ‘Are you sure?'” Adding, theGangubai Kathiawadiactor said: “Because I do have anxiety. He obviously understood that and said, ‘Now, you are going to get reallyanxious, so let’s talk about it. ‘ Let’s talk about what your worst fear is. So, we talked about it…all the way from Bandra to Juhu. And that one moment happened, and it was such a cute moment. She was holding both our faces. I also realised that there’s only love for her.” WhenAlia Bhattspoke about feeling anxious before allowing her daughter Raha to be photographed for the first time, it was a deeply relatable moment for many parents. “Because beneath the celebrity spotlight, the core emotion she expressed is universal – the flutter of anxiety that comes with stepping into something new,” mentioned Delnna Rrajesh, psychotherapist and life coach. Anxiety often intensifies around “firsts.” “First steps. First day at school. First public moment. First big decision involving your child. New experiences carry a mix of excitement, responsibility, andvulnerability. Even when we know it’s a planned step, our minds often run ahead—what if something goes wrong? What if I’m not fully ready? For parents, this anxiety multiplies because the decision isn’t just about them anymore. It’s about their child’s safety, identity, and boundaries,” said Delnna. There’s a simple psychological reason why anxiety spikes during unfamiliar moments. “Our nervous system thrives on predictability. New experiences, no matter how joyful, stretch us out of our comfort zone,” said Delnna. – There’s fear of the unknown– A heightened sense of responsibility– Worry about external judgment or criticism– An emotional tug between protection and growth For parents, these layers deepen because of the primal instinct to keep their child safe. Even a seemingly simple decision like sharing a photo online can stir an emotional storm. Today’s generation of parents faces something previous generations didn’t — the world has blurred the line between private and public. A single image can travel everywhere within minutes. “This creates an internal conflict between wanting to share joy and needing to protect one’s child,” said Delnna. It’s love mixed with responsibility. It’s a natural response to stepping into an unfamiliar but significant moment. – Acknowledge the emotion instead of dismissing it– Ground yourself withbreathor short sensory rituals before the moment– Remind yourself that feeling anxious doesn’t mean you’re making the wrong choice– Set clear boundaries about what you will and won’t share– Focus on what you can control instead of everything that could go wrong From a house of Anil Ambani in Mumbai’s Pali Hill, the Reliance Centre property in Delhi, and other properties across Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kancheepuram, and East Godavari, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached 40 properties worth about Rs 3,084 crore linked to the industrialist in connection with its money laundering probe.", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/when-alia-bhatt-ranbir-kapoor-raha-pap-first-time-anxiety-expert-10329831/", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 3446}, {"source_number": 2, "title": "Why Alia Bhatt is Bollywood 's 'Female Emraan Hashmi'", "snippet": "Alia Bhatt is all of three films old but already has a rep of the more dubious sort to protect.

Alia confessed in an interview, \"People have now started considering me as the female Emraan Hashmi of the industry.\" Emraan, star of films like Murder and Jannat, has long been described as Bollywood’s serial kisser. Alia has no further to look for inspiration than older sister Pooja Bhatt who had kissing scenes in movies like Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahi and Phir Teri Kahani Yaad Aayi. For Alia, very much a new age heroine, screen PDA is no big deal. “I think the media is obsessed with a kiss. It’s silly to make such a big fuss about a 21-year-old girl in the 21st century, if she kisses on screen. In Hollywood they don’t make such an issue about it.

Avengers: Doomsday plot – what will Avengers 5 be about? Avengers: Doomsday trailer – any Avengers 5 footage yet? Avengers: Doomsday might have been delayed until December 2026 , but we have now at least had our first look at Doctor Doom in the MCU . The mid-credit scene of The Fantastic Four: First Steps marks Doctor Doom's MCU debut, although we only see him from behind. Avengers: Doomsday started filming in late April after its unique cast announcement that featured a lot of chairs, including some exciting X-Men additions and major omissions . During Marvel's Comic-Con panel in July 2024, it was confirmed that Joe and Anthony Russo were back to direct Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars . What's more, Robert Downey Jr is back, but not as Iron Man... as Doctor Doom. The Russos are taking over from original director Destin Daniel Cretton, who left the movie in November 2023. Stephen McFeely has written the script, taking over from Jeff Loveness, but Michael Waldron is also helping on Doomsday 's script. The pair will also be writing Avengers: Secret Wars . The next Avengers movie is half of a double bill that will bring The Multiverse Saga to a close , but before we can even start thinking of Secret Wars , there's a lot that needs to be done with Avengers: Doomsday . Here's everything you need to know about Avengers : Doomsday . Alberto E. Rodriguez // Getty Images Sign up to Disney+ Avengers: Doomsday release date – when can we expect Avengers 5? As mentioned above, Avengers: Doomsday has been hit by another release date delay and will now land in cinemas on 18 December 2026 . That's a seven-month delay from the previous release date of 1 May 2026, which itself was a year delay from the original 2 May 2025 release . The delay has also impacted Avengers: Secret Wars which will now land in cinemas on 17 December 2027 instead of 7 May 2027. Filming has at least now started on Avengers: Doomsday and like the Infinity War / Endgame double-bill, filming is planned to start on Avengers: Secret Wars pretty soon after Doomsday wraps. \"We're shooting them fairly back-to-back, it's a lot of work again, we may or may not survive, we'll see,\" Joe Russo confirmed in March 2025 . Marvel Studios Avengers: Doomsday cast – who is joining Robert Downey Jr in Avengers 5? Let's start with the massive news. Robert Downey Jr has been confirmed to play iconic Marvel villain Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday . We don't know exactly how it'll work yet, but it wouldn't be a surprise if this Doctor Doom comes from whatever world the upcoming Fantastic Four movie takes place in. It remains to be seen if Victor Von Doom is a Tony Stark variant. Jesse Grant // Getty Images We had to wait until March 2025 for further official cast additions, but we now know thanks to a bunch of chairs that the following MCU stars are coming back for Avengers: Doomsday : • Chris Hemsworth (Thor) • Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman) • Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America) • Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes) • Letitia Wright (Shuri/Black Panther) • Paul Rudd (Scott Lang/Ant-Man) • Wyatt Russell (John Walker/US Agent) • Tenoch Huerta Mejía (Namor) • Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) • Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) • Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova) Marvel Studios • Kelsey Grammer (Hank McCoy/Beast) • Lewis Pullman (Robert 'Bob' Reynolds/Sentry) • Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres/Falcon) • Joseph Quinn (Johnny Storm/Human Torch) • David Harbour (Red Guardian) • Winston Duke (M'Baku) • Hannah John-Kamen (Ava Starr/Ghost) • Tom Hiddleston (Loki) • Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier/Professor X) • Ian McKellen (Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto) • Alan Cumming (Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler) • Rebecca Romijn (Raven Darkhölme/Mystique) • James Marden (Scott Summers/Cyclops) • Channing Tatum (Remy LeBeau/Gambit) • Pedro Pascal (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic) The presence of the Thunderbolts* and The Fantastic Four casts aren't a surprise, given Feige confirmed they'd be in the Avengers movies at Comic-Con 2024 , but the OG X-Men returns are the ones to get fans most excited. We're still missing some major names that were widely expected to be in Avengers: Doomsday , such as Tom Holland's Spider-Man . However, Downey Jr teased future cast announcements to come in March 2025, but nobody else has been announced yet. Sony Pictures // Marvel Studios Who could those additional stars be? It's unclear at this point, but plenty of MCU stars have been having their say on potential returns. There have been reports that Chris Evans will reprise his role as Steve Rogers in the new movie, but he's denied those .

We break down everything we know about every Marvel movie and TV show currently in the works. by Erik Amaya | May 22, 2025 | Comments TAGGED AS: Marvel , MCU , movies , streaming , TV [Updated August 1, 2025] The story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel Studios itself has been a tumultuous one since the release of Avengers: Endgame . The Phase Four films and television shows left audiences wondering if there was a new saga at all . The need to generate material for Disney+ also left many feeling the studio was unfocused and overextended, something studio president Kevin Feige would partially admit in 2025. Nevertheless, at SDCC 2022, he tried to quell some of these misgivings by revealing the full calendar for Phases Five and Six, labeling the whole thing as “The Multiverse Saga.” But almost as soon as the Multiverse calendar was made public, alterations were made. Movies shifted release dates and production schedules. Two industry strikes forced all television and movie production to grind to halt. Disney itself changed its priorities and instructed Marvel to slow its pipeline. The expected big bad of the new saga, Kang the Conqueror, proved unimpressive in his true debut appearance — Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — while the actor who portrayed him faced criminal charges in New York. He was ultimately let go from his Marvel contract, but it was unclear if Kang would carry on or be completely replaced with a difference character. And it just so happened that Doctor Doom seemed to be the logical replacement and Robert Downey Jr. was available… It all reveals that, despite the planning involved, Marvel Studios is malleable and ready to alter those plans if need be. Meanwhile, back in the MCU, heroes must rise, ne’er-do-wells must do what they do, and Marvel’s First Family must finally take its moment in the spotlight. And, as we have for the last few years, we’re keeping track of it all in this comprehensive guide of every upcoming Marvel Studios film (and television show) with a handy calendar of the studio’s projects through 2027 (and beyond). As always, we will continue to update this page frequently as new details emerge. And be careful: There are spoilers ahead. (Want to see what the other camp is up to? Check out our full breakdown of upcoming DC Studios movies .) WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT In Phase Six And beyond The SDCC 2024 presentation was full of bombast — from a Deadpool choir singing “Like A Prayer” to the Downey as Doom reveal — but was surprisingly short on words like “phase”, “Multiverse”, and “saga.” Consequently, it is unclear if that system of notation is still in place. What you can expect in lieu of phases is the end of the current saga in two upcoming Avengers films and the return of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in his fourth MCU outing. Also, there are a few TV shows readying for release that may still matter to the ongoing threads of Marvel storytelling… Although it remains unclear if phases remain part of the studio’s reported seven year calendar, we’re holding onto the nomenclature for all the projects set for release after First Steps until Feige offers an update on this aspect of the Marvel Method. Eyes of Wakanda (animated series) Premiere Date: August 6, 2025 What We Know: The anthology miniseries focuses on different protectors of Wakanda throughout its history. A clip shown at the 2024 D23 Marvel Animation presentation revealed a female Black Panther protecting her nation’s vibranium resources during the Age of Piracy, for example. Former Marvel storyboard artist Todd Harris serves as the series director and creator while Black Panther director Ryan Coogler serves as an executive producer. In July 2025, Disney released the first trailer for the series. How It Fits in the MCU: Unlike the other animated programs, Eyes of Wakanda details the history of Wakanda within the MCU. Of course, despite the presence of Coogler as an executive producer, we imagine he reserves the right to contradict anything revealed here in a subsequent Wakanda-set project (more on that below). The series will also establish the presence of an Iron Fist in the MCU, although it is unclear if this will undo the one featured in the Netflix Iron Fist series. Marvel Zombies (animated series) Premiere Date: October 2025 What We Know: Spinning off from a season 1 What If…? episode, various Marvel characters attempt to survive a zombie apocalypse. During the D23 Marvel Animation presentation mentioned above, the audience saw an extended clip establishing the fall of San Francisco and, five years later, Shang-Chi, Katy, and Jimmy Woo driving a zombie-infested version of the Fury Road. While it is unclear if the live action actors reprise their roles here, Iman Vellani is set to voice Kamala Khan, who is said to be central to the miniseries. Other characters trying to survive include Kate Bishop, Yelena Belova, and Blade(!).

While concrete story details are limited so far, the Russo Brothers' return to the MCU with Avengers: Doomsday promises to be a crossover event of unprecedented magnitude, with potentially hundreds of extremely powerful villains facing off against the biggest hero line-up ever united in the MCU timeline within one project. There can be no doubt that blood will be spilled. However, complications for Avengers: Doomsday arose based on Jonathan Majors' legal matters , as Majors was found guilty on two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault on December 18, 2023. Shortly after, reports came in that the MCU had cut ties with the actor going forward, and that Avengers: The Kang Dynasty would henceforth be Avengers 5 for the time being, with its new title of Avengers: Doomsday being announced months later. Avengers: Doomsday Latest News Marvel Studios Announces The Cast Of Doomsday Marvel Studios has officially announced the cast of Avengers: Doomsday and, like everyone thought, it features a massive list of characters, with a number of pleasant surprises thrown in for good measure. Included in the frankly absurdly large cast are various members of The Fantastic Four, Thunderbolts, Avengers, and even Fox's original X-Men characters . Of course, other major MCU characters that are typically not associated with a team will be in the film as well. Some of those names announced include Shang-Chi, Shuri, Loki, Thor, and more. Avengers: Doomsday was always thought to be a significant number of characters, but some of the ones announced were incredibly surprising, as it felt like Avengers: Secret Wars would be the one to really bring together characters from the entirety of Marvel's cinematic history. Doctor Doom is going to have his hands full. Avengers: Doomsday Release Date Getting Closer Every Year Doctor Doom descends from the sky wielding a sword, lighting cracking in the background. While it was originally set for release on May 2, 2025, Marvel shifted the Avengers: Doomsday release date to May 1, 2026 . Based on the story focusing on that of iconic Fantastic Four nemesis Doctor Doom, it seems the film will follow on directly from The Fantastic Four 's debut at the start of the MCU's Phase 6, though it's possible that another film could fill in the gap in late 2025, given that Blade was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule. Avengers: Doomsday Cast Info Promised To Be A Massive Cast Link Image Doctor Doom Avengers: Doomsday will revolve around Doctor Doom, who at the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con was announced to be part of the upcoming movie, hence its title. Doctor Doom's casting was also announced, with the iconic MCU Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. set to return to the cinematic universe in this new role . Bringing in Doctor Doom is seemingly a great lead-in to the Secret Wars storyline, as he's also been an antagonist in one of the comic iterations of this narrative. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have begun to talk about Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars , as recent interviews highlight some major points regarding Robert Downey Jr. being cast as Doctor Doom, a decision that has massive implications. In a recent interview with Omelete , Joe Russo talked about Kevin Feige's idea to bring back Robert Downey Jr., stating, \"That was Kevin [Feige], and interesting enough about that was, that conversation was had a while ago. And then Robert tried to talk us into doing it, and we said 'no,' weirdly because we said we wouldn't come back.\" The Fantastic Four All four members of The Fantastic Four will reprise their roles in Avengers: Doomsday. This includes Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing. Given how closely tied the group is with Doctor Doom, they will likely have some of the most significant roles in the entire film. The Thunderbolts Nearly all the Thunderbolts will be coming back for Avengers: Doomsday , which includes Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Wyatt Russell as US Agent, David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, and Lewis Pullman as Sentry. Unfortunately, Taskmaster didn't make the cut, indicating her time in Thunderbolts* will likely be cut short. The Avengers Despite the Avengers breaking up over the course of the MCU, Sam Wilson was determined to assemble a new team following Captain America: Brave New World , and he seems to be doing just that. Alongside Anthony Mackie as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Other Major MCU Characters Alongside the various MCU teams, like Thunderbolts and Avengers, there are a significant number of characters returning in Avengers: Doomsday that have played a significant role in the ", "url": "https://screenrant.com/avengers-doomsday-release-date-cast-story-details/", "domain": "screenrant.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 7, "title": "The Direct 2026's Marvel Studios Movies Will Bring Back 5 Original Avengers", "snippet": "2 weeks ago - While Phase 6 of the MCU kicked ... of fan-favorite Avengers actors in Spider-Man: Brand New Day releasing July 31 and Avengers: Doomsday coming to theaters on December 18....", "full_content": "In 2026, the MCU is returning to its roots with a nostalgic lineup of originalAvengers stars. As the Multiverse Saga approaches its climax, five familiar faces will enter the fray and in more than one movie. While Phase 6 of the MCU kicked off withThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsand is expected to conclude withAvengers: Secret Warsin 2027,Marvel Studios' 2026 slateis where the action ramps up thanks to the return of fan-favoriteAvengersactors inSpider-Man: Brand New Dayreleasing July 31 andAvengers: Doomsdaycoming to theaters on December 18. Given the Multiversal nature of these projects, fans don't yet know the full extent of all their roles, or just which characters they will play, but these five returning stars are giving longtime MCU fans a reason to get excited all over again. It's no secret amongst Marvel fans that Robert Downey Jr. is back in the MCU, but this time as the Multiversal villain Doctor Doom. While he's the headlining villain ofAvengers: Doomsday, his character has alreadyappeared inThe Fantastic Four: First Steps' post-credits sceneand possibly aboard the Fantastic Four ship in theThunderbolts*tag. The question now is whether he will appear inSpider-Man: Brand New Day, both in the movie or in another post-credits scene, and if Robert Downey Jr. could play another version of his villain or Earth-616 hero in the MultiversalDoomsday. Perhaps the biggest mystery on this list, Chris Evans is heavily rumored to be returning inAvengers: Doomsday; however, it's a claim that the original Captain America star has repeatedly denied. Adding to the fan speculation is the fact that Evans reprised his original Marvel role as Johnny Storm forDeadpool & Wolverinein 2024 and Peggy Carter star Hayley Atwell is already confirmed for the 2026 film. Furthermore, Marvel has yet to clarify his character's still-mysterious post-Endgamefate. Finally, there are rumors claiming Evans may be playingSteve Rogers' alternate identity of Nomad. Clearly, there are multiple ways Chris Evans could make an MCU comeback in 2026, and it will be interesting to see which, if any, prove to be true. Unlike some of his originalAvengersco-stars, Chris Hemsworth has continued Thor's story followingEndgamewithThor: Love and Thunderand is confirmed to pick up the hammer once more inAvengers: Doomsday. (check out the 61 stars confirmed and reported forAvengers 5here) Not only will it be interesting to see how he reacts to Multiversal versions of his former teammate, like Robert Downey Jr.'s Doom, butDoomsdaymay also allow him to finally reunite with his brother Loki. Following his role inShe-Hulkfor Disney+, Mark Ruffalo is headed back to the big screen in 2026 with a role alongside Tom Holland inSpider-Man: Brand New Day. However, Ruffalo may not be playing the Smart Hulk fans have grown accustomed to sinceAvengers: Endgame. Instead, there is some buzz that he may be playingthe destructive Savage Hulk forSpider-Man 4. Whether Ruffalo's Smart Hulk, Savage Hulk, or another version of the gamma-powered green giant will appear inAvengers: Doomsdayremains to be seen. According to reports, Nick Fury still has more to do within the MCU. While Marvel Studios has yet to confirm his role inDoomsday, Samuel L. Jackson is rumored for the 2026 film and where he could potentially bridge both the old and new eras of the MCU. It's also possible he will square off against Val (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) after she branded the Thunderbolts the New Avengers in 2025'sThunderbolts*.

( AP: Uncredited ) In short: Marvel has announced its cast for Avengers: Doomsday, including franchise veterans alongside Fantastic Four newcomers and stalwarts from Fox's X-Men movies. The film is set to release in May 2026, with the sequel Avengers: Secret Wars to follow in May 2027. What's next? The films represent a moment of truth for Marvel Studios after falling box office returns and cooling critical reception to more recent projects. Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Anthony Mackie's Captain America, Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Hiddleston's Loki are all returning to the Avengers ensemble, where they are set to joined by several of cinema's original X-Men. The five veterans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are in the cast of 2026's Avengers: Doomsday, which Marvel announced in a series of videos rolled out slowly overnight. Loading Twitter content Patrick Stewart, 84, who played Professor X in Fox's early-2000s X-Men films, and 85-year-old Ian McKellen, who played his arch-nemesis Magneto, are also in the Doomsday cast as Disney and Marvel seek to take advantage of the acquisition of Fox's movie library. Kelsey Grammer, who played Hank \"Beast\" McCoy, was also announced, as was Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler). Their characters were taken on by younger actors in the 2010s X-Men series reboot. The more senior superheroes will be joined by more recent MCU additions, including some who have yet to make their debuts. Vanessa Kirby, set to play the Invisible Woman Sue Storm in this July's Fantastic Four: First Steps, will also appear in Avengers: Doomsday. Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards will join the Avengers too.

Simu Liu, who played the title character in 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, is also in the newly announced cast, as is Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who played the aquatic antagonist Namor in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Letitia Wright, who plays Shuri in the Black Panther films, will also be back among the Avengers, as will other Black Panther alum Winston Duke. Florence Pugh, who will reprise her MCU role as Yelena Belova in the forthcoming Thunderbolts, will also appear in Doomsday, along with cast mate David Harbour as Red Guardian. Some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's biggest and most anticipated names were not among the 27 names announced, though Marvel and Disney could be sitting on them for now. There was no mention of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine or Ryan Reynolds's Deadpool, though the announcement did include Channing Tatum, who played the X-Men's Gambit in last year's Deadpool & Wolverine. Chris Evans was also absent from the cast list. Tom Holland's name did not appear either. Holland's Spider-Man became an Avenger in previous films. However, the character was on loan from owner Sony, whose complicated relationship with Marvel has made the intellectual property a sticking point. Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr announced he was returning to Marvel Cinematic Universe during the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con. ( Getty Images: Matt Winkelmeyer ) Robert Downey Jr revealed last summer that he will be returning to the MCU to play the villain Doctor Doom in the next set of Avengers films. Avengers: Doomsday, set for release in May 2026, will be the fifth Avengers movie, and the first since 2019's Avengers Endgame became one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Moment of truth for Marvel Marvel has been struggling to recover its cultural buzz and box office mojo ever since Endgame. However, it hopes the forthcoming ensemble films will bring back the magic that dominated cinema for more than a decade. The success of the first 23 films in the franchise — the Infinity Saga — has been difficult to emulate, with the so-called Multiverse Saga seeing the first box office flops in the studio's history: 2021's Eternals and 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Both films also copped \"rotten\" critic scores on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, another first for the MCU. Despite decent reviews , 2023's The Marvels was the MCU's lowest-grossing film ever, failing to break even on its more than $US300 million ($476.4 million) budget.

The MCU has been struggling, and in a rather desperate move, decided to revert back to ‘Avengers’ movies — albeit without Iron Man, Captain America, and Hulk. “Avengers: Doomsday” wrapped its marathon shoot this year, rolling cameras from April 28 until mid-September. Setting aside potential reshoots, the film now gets a luxurious 15-month post-production “break.” Why so much breathing room? Easy — after finishing ‘Doomsday,’ the Russo brothers immediately pivot to its follow-up, “Avengers: Secret Wars.” Both films are rumored to become the costliest in Hollywood history, with budgets said to be in excess of 500M+ (although understandably, we cannot confirm at this time). Hollywood North Buzz now claims “Secret Wars” will mirror the same April-through-September shoot next year in Vancouver. Another 15-month post window. Another VFX behemoth. More endless cameos — it’s all dialed to 11. Expect reshoots, and barely a finished script. Oh, and did I mention the second phase of filming for ‘Doomsday’ — in other words, reshoots — kicks off in January 2026? There were probably some rewrites, maybe even a reshuffled cast list, since Marvel has been locking pieces of this puzzle together right up until the very last second. The official synopsis includes Robert Downey Jr.’s return to Marvel — but this time as Doom himself. Not much else is known about the story being told here. Stephen McFeely and Michael Waldron are credited on the screenplay(s). To give perspective: “Avengers: Endgame” cost $356M to make. ‘Doomsday’ already has $90M publicly accounted for — $40M for the Russos, $50M for Robert Downey Jr. With the avalanche of names reportedly attached, I’d be shocked if the final tally is under $400M. And that’s me being conservative. Marvel continues to push the envelope: how many characters can they squeeze into a single movie before it collapses under its own weight?

It has grown into one of the most popular franchises in modern cinema, with its movies regularly breaking box office records and the franchise weaving itself a place in the fabric of pop culture as a result. As always, Marvel Studios are looking to the future, with several exciting projects on the horizon. Videos by ComicBook.com 2026 is already shaping up to be an important year for the MCU. The year is set to see numerous releases for the franchise, bringing its story toward the conclusion of the Multiverse Saga as part of the build-up to Avengers: Secret Wars . Though there are still MCU releases set for late 2025 , Marvel has also got some incredibly exciting projects currently slated for release in 2026. Marvel Movies Set for 2026 Release Spider-Man: Brand New Day (July 31, 2026) Spider-Man’s fourth solo movie in the MCU is one of the most anticipated projects in the franchise’s near future, largely due to the already exceptional MCU stories which have featured the hero. Subtitled Brand New Day , the movie is set to explore Spider-Man’s work as a New York hero after magically erasing his identity as Peter Parker. With the introduction of Mephisto into the MCU in Ironheart , Spider-Man: Brand New Day is now looking even more exciting, and is currently set for release on July 31, 2026. Avengers: Doomsday (December 18, 2026) What may well be one of the most exciting movies in the MCU is also set for a 2026 release in the form of Avengers: Doomsday . The movie is set to introduce long-awaited villain Doctor Doom into the MCU, with Robert Downey Jr. announced to be returning to play the iconic antagonist. Doomsday will also feature an expansive cast of existing MCU heroes, with various actors set to reprise their Marvel roles in the first part of the Multiverse Saga’s conclusion. Avengers: Doomsday is currently slated for release on December 18, 2026. Marvel TV Shows Set for 2026 Release Daredevil: Born Again Season 2 (March 2026) 2026 is also set to feature the release of a new instalment of an existing MCU Disney+ series , with Daredevil: Born Again Season 2 scheduled to premiere in March. It will follow on directly from the end of Season 1, which saw Daredevil and Kingpin once again at odds in the MCU. Season 2 of the show will bring back the cast from first season and see Daredevil wage all-out war on Wilson Fisk in an attempt to thwart his plans for New York.

The series, which will feature Vision following his resurrection in WandaVision , will surely feature the return of other MCU characters , including the long-awaited revival of Ultron after his apparent demise in 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron . The show has not yet been given a confirmed release date, but is still currently set for release in 2026 at the time of writing. Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Season 2 (TBC) Even before the first season had been released, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man was renewed for a second season, which is currently set for a 2026 release. With the first season having received glowing reviews, the animated show’s return is highly anticipated, with several exciting new characters also set to appear. An official release date has not been set, but Season 2 is currently slated for release some time in 2026. The Punisher Special (TBC) After Punisher’s appearance in Daredevil: Born Again , Frank Castle’s MCU story has been confirmed as far from over. The vigilante anti-hero has always proved a fan favorite, with Jon Bernthal’s performance widely cited as one of the best iterations of the character. He is set to return to the MCU in a mid-length special presentation in the vein of Werewolf by Night and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special . While an official date has not been set, it is currently tipped for a 2026 release. X-Men ‘97 Season 2 (TBC) Season 1 of X-Men ’97 brought Marvel’s mutant heroes to the MCU in emphatic fashion, and though it was swiftly renewed for another season, a two-year wait was announced. That wait sets X-Men ’97 Season 2 up for release in 2026, even though a specific date has yet to be formally announced for the next instalment. Regardless, the popularity of Season 1 and the considerable wait for the follow-up makes X-Men ’97 Season 2 yet another exciting Marvel release slated for 2026. 10 Marvel Deaths That the MCU Should Change After Avengers: Secret Wars Tagged: Avengers: Doomsday , List Feature , Marvel Cinematic Universe , Spider-Man: Brand New Day Follow Us ", "url": "https://comicbook.com/movies/news/marvel-movies-tv-shows-releasing-2026-list/", "domain": "comicbook.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 5856}, {"source_number": 11, "title": "Deadline Next 'Avengers' Movies Push Release Dates", "snippet": "May 23, 2025 - Marvel Studios is pushing back the release of its next two Avengers films, directed by the Russo Brothers.

The Marvel movies of 2025 saw the franchise undergo somewhat of a resurgence, with the likes of Thunderbolts* and The Fantastic Four: First Steps being considered a critical return to form for the MCU. The upcoming Marvel movies of 2026 will look to continue this streak, with a slate of exciting projects planned. Despite only having two movies in 2026, Marvel Studios seems set for a good year. This will hopefully be reflected in the box office as much as audience and critical ratings, with many dreaming that 2026 will include two of the best-ranked MCU movies ever . This is without mentioning the various Marvel TV shows that will be released in 2026. 2025 was an illustrious year for Marvel in TV, with the franchise spawning several live-action series as well as a handful of animated efforts. With all that being said, here is a look forward to 2026 for Marvel Studios, from the feature films to the small-screen stories planned. Spider-Man: Brand New Day Tom Holland showing off his Spider-Man: Brand New Day (2026) suit The first Marvel Studios movie being released in 2026 is Spider-Man: Brand New Day . The story of Spider-Man: Brand New Day will follow on from 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home , chronicling Peter Parker's continued exploits in the MCU now that everyone on Earth has forgotten his existence. Directed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton, Spider-Man: Brand New Day is expected to hit theaters on July 31, 2026 . The exact plot of the film has been kept under wraps thus far, but it is expected to be a more street-level Spider-Man movie with Peter entering the next phase of his life. Tom Holland will reprise his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, with several new cast members for Spider-Man: Brand New Day confirmed. Jon Bernthal, Mark Ruffalo, and Michael Mando will reprise their previous MCU roles as The Punisher, Hulk, and Scorpion, respectively. Zendaya's MJ and Jacob Batalon's Ned will also return, though to what extent remains unknown. New cast members include Stranger Things' Sadie Sink and The Bear 's Liza Colon-Zayas. Spider-Man: Brand New Day will look to build on the highly successful Homecoming trilogy, ushering in a new age of the titular Web-Slinger in the MCU and potentially leading to another two movies in the franchise's second Spider-Man trilogy. Avengers: Doomsday Robert Downey Jr sitting in a set chair with the Avengers: Doomsday cast. There are only two Marvel movies in 2026, though they are two of the biggest. Alongside Spider-Man: Brand New Day , Avengers: Doomsday is scheduled to release in theaters on December 18, 2026 ​​​​​​. Avengers: Doomsday 's story has been teased throughout the last few MCU movies, setting up Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the franchise as the villainous Doctor Doom. Originally, Avengers: Doomsday was supposed to be the story of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty . However, Kang the Conqueror actor Jonathan Majors was fired by Marvel after his assault charges, leading to a change in direction. In July 2024, Marvel Studios confirmed Avengers: Doomsday with RDJ as the new Multiverse Saga villain and returning directors, the Russo Brothers, attached . Since then, Avengers: Doomsday 's cast list has been confirmed, with the film shaping up to tell the story of how The Avengers, the New Avengers, The Fantastic Four, and the X-Men will team up to stop whatever sinister plans Doom has for the multiverse. What Doom’s plan is remains to be seen, but The Fantastic Four: First Steps’ post-credit scene teased this. This scene showcased Doctor Doom appearing to Franklin Richards, the incredibly powerful, reality-altering son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm. With Avengers: Doomsday confirmed to tie into 2027's Avengers: Secret Wars, it is clear that Franklin will be important to Doom's plans. Shooting on Avengers: Doomsday is underway until late October 2025, priming the film for its 2026 release. Every MCU Show Releasing In 2026 Daredevil born again poster In comparison to previous years, the MCU is dialing back its TV productions in 2026. However, that is not to say there are none. Three Marvel Television productions are expected in 2026 , with two coming in live-action format and one being animated. Starting with the latter, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2 is expected in 2026. The first season of the animated show that focused on an alternate dimension's Peter Parker was released in January 2025. During an interview with Collider that year, Marvel Studios' Head of Television Brad Winderbaum confirmed that seasons of the show would come annually, with the second coming \"a little bit more than a year\" after its debut. Beyond Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man season 2, Marvel Studios will also release Daredevil: Born Again season 2 and Vision Quest in 2026 .

The South Korean singer, 26, is performing alone while some of the older band members do military service. His album Golden is sung in English and includes collaborations with Ed Sheeran, Latto and Shawn Mendes. USA Today's Jennifer McClellan showered praise on Golden, saying he's \"punched his ticket to pop superstardom\". She wrote: \"Sure, as a member of BTS he had already reached pinnacles of fame most could only imagine. Yet he was one of seven in a group that, however talented, ruled within the realm of K-pop. \"That changes today.\" Getty Images As the youngest member of BTS, Jung Kook has been a star since the age of 15 NME's Rhian Daly declared that Golden \"more than secures him the throne\" as this decade's pop king. \"So far, the 2020s have been lacking one huge male solo star that reigns over the pop world but, with Golden, BTS's Jungkook proves he's more than up to the task,\" she said. \"For the most part, Golden works and achieves exactly what its mission seemingly is - capture Jungkook's multifaceted artistry, charismatic vocals and irresistible pop appeal in 10 easily palatable songs primed for commercial success.\" 'Part Ronan Keating, part Craig David' The Associated Press's Maria Sherman also praised the album, saying: \"The heavily Anglophonic Golden, a reference to his nickname of 'the golden maknae,' (golden youngest in Korean), is one of the strongest pop debuts of the year, a direct reflection of his love of retro-pop sounds... \"Across this release, Jung Kook demonstrates a deep understanding of pop performance - and how, in the modern era, that requires innovative collaborations, heavily featured throughout his solo album,\" she added. The i newspaper's Ed Power said the \"BTS heartthrob is part Ronan Keating, part Craig David - and it's a triumph\". Getty Images BTS are the most successful group to emerge from South Korea \"The biggest surprise is mega-hit Seven,\" Power continued. \"It has smashed records by overtaking Miley Cyrus's Flowers to become the fastest release in history to clock up one billion Spotify plays. Popularity aside, its most striking quality, however, is the extent to which it worships at the altar of Craig David's 7 Days. \"'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,' sings Jungkook in his light, expressive voice. \"Then, when you think he's going to croon, 'we chill on Sunday', he swerves into a chorus so rude, sensitive listeners will require a lie-down.\" The Standard's David Smyth commented that \"as the baby of the group, vastly famous since the age of 15, he's in a great position for further success.\" Justin Timberlake, Harry Styles and Robbie Williams were also the youngest members of their boy bands, he noted. There are \"a lot of boxes are ticked for pop lovers\", he added. \"What elevates it is his fluid, expressive voice, which consistently raises chart-friendly material to a higher plane.\" 'Competent' The Guardian's Alexis Petridis was more lukewarm, saying Jung Kook \"follows a well-worn path from boyband member to solo star, plunging into competent pop-R&B\". \"It's well-made, hooky - but nevertheless, Golden is an album bound to leave more agnostic listeners pondering what the fuss is about. If you detach the music from the pop world that spawned it... it just sounds like decent mainstream pop,\" he wrote. BTS have become a global sensation since their debut 10 years ago, and are credited with helping to boost the profile of Korean culture worldwide.

I first covered BTS, the K-pop act that became a global pop cultural phenomenon, for this publication in 2017. At the time, we had no way of knowing how far the group and its seven members would go—much less that eight years on, they would be celebrating their 12th anniversary with a triumphant return to the public eye, as all members complete their mandatory military service this month. Somehow, BTS has once again defied expectations, remaining relevant and beloved despite a three-year hiatus. The last few years saw the seven members focus on their individual passions and solo careers—including Jungkook, the youngest, whose all-English debut solo album Golden made waves in the Western pop sphere in 2023. It’s why when I was first asked to examine this moment in The Meaning of Jungkook: The Triumph of BTS and the Making of a Global Pop Superstar (out now from Simon & Schuster), a book that explores the eponymous singer’s rise alongside the wider K-pop phenomenon, I balked at the task. To do justice to the seven members of BTS in the span of one book felt outright impossible, and Jungkook alone had accomplished so much since his 2013 debut that it was difficult to narrow focus and analyze what had propelled him so far. The factors that led to the rise of Jungkook are manifold and complex, and the K-pop industry is a beast that was born long before Jungkook himself. Even for me, a Korean-American writer who has lived for years in both countries, there was a lot to dissect. Here, five things I learned writing The Meaning of Jungkook. The Impact of Soul Train I knew that a great deal of K-pop choreography drew influence from Michael Jackson, who is cited as a hero by K-pop dancers to this day. I didn’t know that Jackson’s early performances were filtered directly into the country by way of American Forces Korean Network (AFKN), the broadcasting station that provided American entertainment to the military stationed in South Korea after the Korean War. Easily accessed by Koreans, shows like Soul Train and Solid Gold set the early building blocks for the Korean dancers and singers to come, leading all the way to Jungkook’s Michael Jackson–inspired “Standing Next to You.” The Grindset Mindset Having lived and worked in Seoul, I was familiar with the grueling work culture that far surpassed anything I had experienced in New York. Still, I was awed by Jungkook’s approach to practice and improvement. One small example: Finding his vocal skills lacking when BTS debuted, Jungkook began to practice singing at every opportune moment—in the green room, the company car, his hotel room, walking down the street. It’s a habit he maintained through his solo debut, as captured in documentary footage, and speaks louder than words. Just How Far He’ll Go The BTS members are known for their dedication, going to great lengths to deliver their world-class performances: Jungkook famously collapsed backstage in Chile at the BTS Wings Tour in 2017, as seen in the Burn the Stage docuseries. I was surprised to learn that Jungkook was also ill during his promotions for “Seven (Feat. Latto).” Given his strong, clear singing voice on stages in New York and London, one would never know that he was pushing through a nasty cold. The Value—and the Hazards—of His Perfectionism In the dance practice room and the recording booth, Jungkook will perform take after take after take, intent on delivering the best he possibly can. Yet he would also be the first to admit that the same exacting nature common in Korean culture can be a weakness. Despite the other BTS members’ encouragement, he has a habit of writing songs and then deleting them if he feels they don’t pass muster. As he completes his military service and returns to work, it will be interesting to see how his creative approach has (or hasn’t) changed. BTS Still Comes First A lot has been made about Jungkook as a solo artist. For years, the media has positioned him as a star with breakout potential akin to a Justin Timberlake or Harry Styles. But in his own words, “BTS is more important,” and he had always planned to put the group before his solo ambitions. It’s impossible to truly know a person from afar, but Jungkook has long made one thing is clear: He is devoted to BTS (and their ARMY). Now that they’re back, the next chapter of K-pop history is just beginning.

For a background there was coronavirus outbreak in Itaewon clubs, that led to surge of the infections in SK. Goverment has been tracking those who have been in order for them to get tested and there has been request that anyone who visited the clubs between April 24 and May 6 should self-quarantine. There was first of rumours of various idols being sighted in the Itaewon clubs during 25th and 26th April, but companies stayed quiet about. However after Dispatch came and confirmed that Jungkook (BTS), Mingyu (Seventeen), Jaehyun (NCT) and Cha Eunwoo (Astro) had been clubbing in Itaewon and that many of them hadn't been self-quarantined afterwards- scandal breakout and the idols have been met with criticism over their actions. Agencies of the said idols have issued apologies after the article was released and said that their artist has been tested negative. However there is still backlash of the artist not self-quarantining and not giving apologies themselves apart from Cha Eunwoo and Jaehyun. -- I'm personally not big into shaming people over COVID stuff (unless it's braindead stuff), cause there is not lot of solid information yet and circumstances are different. But as a idols it would been best for them to show example by self-quarantining for two weeks after possible exposure as was recommended (even if you first get tested negative you might still be carrier of the virus). I get the backlash in that sense and I think fans shouldn't be too quick to defend it either- but the hate seems bit excessive too considering they were at least tested negative and haven't got symptoms.

One of them being the fact that they had just held 2 sold-out shows in Wembley Stadium for “ LOVE YOURSELF : SPEAK YOURSELF ” tour. This is definitely a phenomenal moment for many artists and especially for the boys to have their fans filled up the entire stadium. Needless to say, BTS was touched when the fans began to sing one of their songs, ‘Young Forever’ as a surprise. It is a song that touches on the doubts and fears BTS has on themselves while at the same time, telling their fans not to give up on their dreams. BTS’s Jimin also mentioned that it was one of the songs which had given him strength when he needed it the most. With that being said, fellow member Jungkook and Jimin were seen crying later on. It looked like both of them were overwhelmed by their emotions and fans who were present also could not help but find the moment touching too. Those who were not present but watched through the live-stream on V-Live also left comments online, telling that they love them and will continue to support them.

But some individuals take a different approach. ActorAlia Bhattonce shared in an interview withETimes, “If anybody asks me, ‘would you go back and change anything?’ or ‘Anything that you regret?’ I genuinely have no regrets.” She continued, “I have nothing that I would change because the person I am today is because of all the steps I have taken for the last how many ever years. I’m 29 now. And yeah, I think in general, I am very grateful for all the work that I’ve gotten. But I’ve worked really, really hard.” She went on to add the importance of doing your best at work, stating, “Hard work is a given in any field. So, I definitely feel that none of this was achievable without blood, sweat, and tears… and sleepless nights that I have endured. But every moment was worth it.” Sonal Khangarot, licensed rehabilitation counsellor and psychotherapist, The Answer Room, tellsindianexpress.com, “There are various angles to look at this question from. On one end, it showcases the art of acceptance, which is something almost everyone struggles with. We believe that we have to be perfect, and progress would just not do — hashtag hustle culture, deregulated nervous system, increase in burnout and emotional fatigue.” So, she adds that for someone to say they do not have regrets, it means they have done enough self-work to notice “that our present is something that we have some amount of conscious control over, and past and future are more uncontrollable.” From another angle, Khangarot states, this could look at a shutting down pattern or numbing down oneself by overcompensating for the wrong one has done in life, which I don’t feel is the case here, but can be a way of looking at the question. Ultimately, the balance lies in acceptance without avoidance. “Shifting from dwelling on past mistakes to accepting them as part of one’s life journey begins with self-awareness, recognising thought patterns,emotional triggers, and the meaning we attach to past events,” says Khangarot. Self-work involves practices like cognitive restructuring to challenge self-blame, mindfulness to stay present, and self-compassion to replace harsh inner criticism with understanding. Khangarot concludes, “Psychologically, parameters such as resilience, emotional regulation, and secure self-esteem play a key role. Working with a mental health professional can provide structured guidance, trauma processing, and tools to reframe past experiences, enabling individuals to see mistakes as stepping stones rather than roadblocks in their personal growth journey.” Rahul Gandhi accuses BJP of rigging Haryana elections with evidence of voter fraud.

Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Alia Bhatt is the most in-demand young actress in Bollywood today. All of two films old, Alia combines fresh-faced charm with very real acting chops and has been hailed as the next best thing by critics. On her 21st birthday, a look at her life and fledgling career. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Alia was born on March 15, 1993 to producer-director Mahesh Bhatt and his second wife, actress Soni Razdan. She is the half-sister of actors Pooja Bhatt and Rahul Bhatt and the niece of producer Mukesh Bhatt. Actor Emraan Hashmi and director Mohit Suri are her cousins. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Alia has always wanted to become a Bollywood star, as she confessed on Koffee With Karan . At six, she made a cameo appearance playing the younger version of Preity Zinta in the 1999 film Sangharsh . Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Unlike her sister Pooja, there was no readymade launch pad in the form of a Mahesh Bhatt film for Alia. Instead, she made her debut as a lead actress in Karan Johar's 2012 hit Student Of The Year opposite fellow Bollywood rookies Siddharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Alia was then cast as Veera, a poor little rich girl kidnapped and taken on a road trip which turns out to be a journey of self-discovery, in Imtiaz Ali's Highway. The film released in February 2014 to rave reviews and Alia's performance was singled out for praise. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Alia has also begun forging a parallel career singing playback. She made her debut as a crooner with the song Sooha Saha in Highway . Composer A R Rahman was so impressed with her rendition that he insisted that she should continue her vocal training at his institute. Some reports even suggested a future collaboration between the two. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email On the same the day Highway released, the first look of Alia's next film 2 States was released on Twitter. The movie, produced by Karan Johar, is based on a bestselling novel written by Chetan Bhagat. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Alia created a stir when she invited the media to her engagement on Twitter. This event was later revealed to be the launch of the trailer of 2 States in which she plays a South Indian who falls in love with the Punjabi Arjun Kapoor. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Even as the songs from 2 States make a splash across TV screens and the internet, Alia is already shooting for her next project titled Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania , opposite her Student Of The Year co-star Varun Dhawan. Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Outspoken Alia is officially single but is rumoured to be dating her 2 States hero Arjun Kapoor. She has previously been linked with both her Student Of The Year co-stars, Sidharth and Varun. Given how un-guarded she usually is in interviews, we're guessing Alia might soon out herself and Arjun.

The CX300, one of two all-electric aircraft being developed by Beta, also took off at the airport—better known as Boeing Field—as part of a live demonstration on Tuesday. In attendance were officials from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and other state agencies, Boeing Field director John Parrott, and “industry leaders from across Washington,” Beta said. WSDOT is one of more than 30 state transportation agencies comprising the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Multistate Collaborative , which serves as a forum to discuss policy and infrastructure requirements for electric aircraft and other new technologies. “We’re taking action to reduce our airport’s carbon impact, and part of how we do that is by embracing new technologies like electric aircraft,” Parrott said in a statement. “We’re proud to host Beta Technologies and its Alia aircraft as a demonstration of a new era in aviation.” Beta Stays Busy Beta has made a point of showcasing the CX300 publicly as often as possible. Earlier this year, for example, it completed a 25-state, 8,000 nm barnstorm across the U.S., flying in day, night, VFR, and IFR conditions. It later headed to Europe, stopping at the Paris Air Show during a “Grand Tour” en route to Norway, where customer Bristow Group is conducting flight testing . Though it is not yet certified, the aircraft has had some impressive moments during its dress rehearsal. On its barnstorm, for example, the CX300 flew IFR into Georgia’s Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL)—the busiest in the world. In June, it became the first electric aircraft to land with passengers at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (KJFK). The model’s most distinctive feature is its distributed electric propulsion system, which comprises battery packs and a five-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. The batteries can be fully recharged within an hour. Per Beta, the aircraft produces 75 percent fewer emissions than a Cessna 208 while operating at a fraction of the cost. The CX300 has a demonstrated range of 336 nm and projected cruise speed of about 135 knots. Beta envisions it handling both passenger and cargo missions. The company is also developing the Alia A250, an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) variant that is expected to be certified after the CX300. It features a pusher propeller and four Part 35-certified vertical lift propellers specially designed by Hartzell. Production of both models will take place at a 200,000-square-foot plant in Vermont. In addition to aircraft, Beta is also building out a nationwide network of electric chargers. It has about 50 sites online, with the vast majority concentrated along the East Coast. However, FBO electrification agreements with Atlantic Aviation and Signature Aviation could allow it to begin expanding West. A handful of Washington state airports have shown interest in electrifying their own terminals. Last year, six of them—including Boeing Field—applied for $10 million in grants that would cover one or two charging stations per airport.

The crew “were telling [me] where all these spots are — Southall, where you have amazing Indian restaurants. They got me some Indian food that really sated my tummy. There are so many Indian restaurants in London that it made me much more comfortable.” Bhatt comes from Bollywood royalty — her father Mahesh Bhatt is a famous director, and her mother Soni Razdan, an actor. Razdan was born in Birmingham, England, and although Bhatt grew up in India, she holds British citizenship and has a home in London. Her fame follows her globally, but she says she can find parts of London where she can relax in anonymity. “London has a lot of people from India… walking down Oxford Street won’t be very comfortable for me, you have to find those in-between spots. I do love spending time in London, walking around. I cannot really do that in Mumbai, which is why London is one of my top holiday destinations.” The 30-year-old actress, who became a mother late last year following her marriage to Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoor, has played dozens of different roles since debuting as a child actor at the age of six. A multi-award winner in India, Bhatt has portrayed a victim of drug abuse, an undercover spy, possessive girlfriend and a prostitute among her plethora of roles. Her films have grossed hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide. She recently moved into production, setting up own production house, Eternal Sunshine in 2021. Eternal’s first production was Netflix’s “Darlings,” alongside Shah Rukh Khan. Her next project, currently shooting in Mumbai, is thriller “Jigra,” which she is co-producing with India’s long-established Dharma Productions, with a release slated for Sept. 27, 2024. “We are in the middle of filming. I just wrapped my schedule yesterday and flew out [to Jeddah].” “It is my first intense thriller – not sure I can talk too much about it – there is some thrill and drama involved,” she added. Bhatt is also an Indian global brand ambassador for luxury goods firm Gucci, and has her own sustainable clothing brand, Ed-a-Mamma and a charitable eco-initiative, CoExist. Following her Hollywood debut, she is hoping to do more work in Tinseltown. During the SAG strike plans to look for new projects were put on hold, but she says she is now reading scripts and is “pretty sure something will materialize soon.” Best of Variety Oscars Predictions: Animated Feature - Could Hayao Miyazaki's 'The Boy and the Heron' Challenge 'Spider-Verse?'

When Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra first walked towards the audience on the silver screen and made their debut with Karan Johar’s Student of the Year in 2012, little did they know that they would become stars just after their first film. Needless to say, the film was a huge hit among the masses back then for all the obvious reasons. Ever since the glam launch of the trio, there has been no looking back for them in the industry. From working with top actors of the film industry to delivering versatile and power-packed performances, they have all carved their own paths with their choice of films and are bankable stars today. As their superhit debut completes 8 years of its release today, here are some of the most memorable work of the actors. Alia Bhatt Over the years, Alia has proved to be one of the most courageous actresses in B-Town - one who's ready to take any challenge head-on. With every film she has done, Alia reminded the audience that she has no equal in Bollywood and that her future is only bound to get brighter. Alia, Varun and Sidharth in SOTY The actress started her journey as an immature and bubbly college girl in SOTY and with her very next film Highway, she showed that she can deliver a powerful and sensitive performance. Despite being the daughter of filmmaker and coming from a filmy background, it wasn’t a cakewalk for Alia as questions were raised whether she could do justice to a character like Veera in Highway. However, soon after the film released, she received immense appreciation from the entire film fraternity as well as the audience and instantly became a favourite. In 2016, with Udta Punjab, Alia once again proved that she can seep inside the skin of her character effortlessly and that nothing can stop her from moving upwards. She essayed the role of a Bihari migrant worker who wanted to become a national-level hockey player, but instead gets herself embroiled in the drug-peddling business of Punjab. Then came Raazi alongside actor Vicky Kaushal. Her performance in the film raised the bar not only for herself but also for her fellow actresses as she entered a completely different trajectory. Alia proved that she could carry the film on her shoulders as the lead character. In Raazi, Alia played the role of Sehmat Khan, an undercover RAW agent who marries into a Pakistani family for the sole purpose of protecting her nation from an impending threat. Indeed, it takes courage to choose such a film without glamour and typical Bollywood masala after having delivered a few commercial blockbusters. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that her choice of films proves she is an actress blessed with plenty of intelligence, who's not afraid to experiment with her roles or films. Alia in Raazi With Safeena from Gully Boy, Alia became the nation's favourite girlfriend, who pushed her boyfriend Murad (played by Ranveer Singh) to achieve his dream of becoming a rapper. Well, the show has just begun for Alia as she is all set to embrace a role different from everything she has done until now with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming film Gangubai Kathiawadi. Alia plays the titular character and will essay the role of a brothel owner and matriarch from the streets of Mumbai. Varun Dhawan Born to ace filmmaker David Dhawan, Varun was hailed as the 'newest chocolate boy of B-Town' after he made his Bollywood debut. But not many are aware of the fact that he had previously worked as an assistant director to KJo on My Name Is Khan (2010). There has been no looking back for the actor ever since his debut and he has acted in several blockbuster films. After SOTY, Varun played a typical Delhi boy in Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania, and not only did he win Alia Bhatt's heart in the film as Humpty, but also that of the people watching him. Directed by Shashank Khaitan, it was only the second film for Varun, but it did impress the viewers and critics alike and was one of the super hit films of that year. Shedding his much-loved chocolate boy image, Varun emerged as the angry, young man of Bollywood with Sriram Raghavan's action thriller Badlapur. His role in Badlapur was a critically acclaimed one and it took everyone by surprise, especially those who were used to seeing him only in light-hearted romcoms. Varun in Badlapur Several cine-lovers left the theatres teary-eyed after watching Varun’s performance as Danish Walia aka Dan in Shoojit Sircar's October. Unlike every other character that he had played, Dan was loved for his rather quiet, innocent and inquisitive nature.

From her debut in Student of the Year to her critically acclaimed performances in Raazi , Gangubai Kathiawadi , and Highway , Alia has proved her versatility and dedication to her craft. But while she slays it on screen and in the gym, her unfiltered love for food makes her all the more relatable. Despite her fast-paced lifestyle and strict fitness routine, Alia never hides the fact that she loves indulging in her favourite dishes, be it home-cooked comfort meals or guilty pleasures on a cheat day. She believes in maintaining a balanced, wholesome diet and often talks about eating mindfully rather than starving or crash dieting. Let’s dig into the world of Alia Bhatt favourite food and find out what her taste buds truly crave! Alia Bhatt’s Top 6 Favourite Foods When it comes to Alia Bhatt favourite food, she prefers simple, nutritious, home-style Indian food. She appreciates food that is healthy and nutritious. Here are some of her most favourite food dishes: 1. Dal Chawal This classic Indian combo of dal chawal , lentils and rice, is Alia Bhatt’s favourite dish. She has often mentioned how she loves this humble, nourishing meal, especially when it’s made by her mom, Soni Razdan. Rich in protein, iron, and fiber, dal chawal is wholesome, soothing, and always hits the spot. For Alia, this dish is more than just food; it’s an emotional connection to home and simplicity. 2. Bhindi (Okra) Yes, this might surprise many, but bhindi (okra) is Alia favourite food. Whether it’s crispy, stuffed, or stir-fried with spices, Alia finds it both delicious and nutritious. Bhindi is rich in dietary fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins, making it a great choice for someone like Alia who’s health-conscious but still wants a flavorful meal. 3. Tamatar ki Sabzi (Tomato Curry) Another Alia Bhatt favourite dish is from her comfort food collection. She enjoys tamatar ki sabzi, which is light, tangy, and incredibly flavorful. Made with fresh tomatoes, spices, and a hint of sweetness, this curry is often paired with roti or rice. It’s a great vegetarian option that’s low in calories but high in flavor, aligning perfectly with Alia’s clean eating preferences. 4. Spaghetti Alia isn’t shy about her love for Italian food either. She has expressed her love for spaghetti, especially with a well-made tomato or pesto-based pasta. It’s one of her go-to meals when she’s in the mood for something international yet comforting. While she avoids heavy cream-based sauces, Alia prefers her pasta light, aromatic, and full of herbs. 5. Poha & Chaas A true Mumbai girl at heart, Alia loves her poha , a light and healthy Maharashtrian breakfast dish made with flattened rice, mustard seeds, green chilies, onions, and coriander. It’s easy on the stomach and packs a lot of flavor. Paired with a glass of chaas (buttermilk), this combo makes for a perfect start to her day, keeping her energized and refreshed without feeling too heavy. 6. Tadka Dahi (Tempered Yogurt) Alia is a fan of tadka dahi, which is simply yogurt that’s topped with a sizzling tempering of mustard seeds, curry leaves, green chilies, and sometimes garlic. It’s a cooling, probiotic-rich side dish that goes with almost anything, be it rice, paratha, or sabzi. Not only is it gut-friendly, but it’s also incredibly flavorful, making it one of her go-to add-ons for lunch or dinner. What Alia Bhatt Eats on Her Cheat Days Even celebrities have cravings, and Alia is no different. While she follows a clean, balanced diet most days, cheat days are when she lets her foodie soul run wild. And what tops her cheat-day list? Let’s see. 1. Pizza Pizza is Alia Bhatt favourite food and an ultimate cheat-day indulgence. Whether it’s a classic Margherita or a gourmet-style truffle mushroom pizza, she absolutely adores it. What makes it special? The cheese, the carbs, the satisfaction, everything that spells comfort and celebration in one bite. Alia has even shared on social media how she is “married to pizza” emotionally, and honestly, who can blame her? 2. French Fries The crispy, salty, golden perfection that is french fries is another cheat-day favorite for Alia. She’s admitted to her weakness for fries, especially when they’re served hot and fresh. Whether it’s with a burger or just by themselves, French fries are the kind of snack that brings Alia instant joy and makes her fans love her even more for being so real.

Saziea Biva , Staff Reporter | July 20, 2023 Here is Alia Bhatt as Shanaya at the premiere for her debut movie ‘Student of The Year.’ (Photo Credit: Bollywood Hungama, CC BY 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons) Alia Bhatt, an iconic Bollywood actress, has a long and successful career. Bhatt gained fame through her work in movies such as Brahmastra and Student of the Year . Bhatt has become one of the Bollywood industry’s most sought out actresses due to her exemplary acting skills which contributed to her massive fan base. She was involved in the Bollywood industry from a young age: Mahesh Bhatt, her father, is a celebrated film director while her mother, Soni Razdan, was also an actress. Alia Bhatt’s path to fame started from her debut in the 2012 movie Student of The Year . Student of the Year, directed by Punit Malhotra and Karan Johar, became a fan favorite for many. Student of the Year is a film which revolves around the competitive world of students competing for a prestigious title, showcasing friendship, love, and ambition in a high-octane drama. This marked the debut of Alia Bhatt along with her co-actors, Siddharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan. The movie revolves around the lives of three characters: Bhatt as Shanaya, the character of Abhimanyu, and the character of Rohan. Bhatt embodied the role of the energetic and fashionable girl effortlessly. Although this was just the beginning of Bhatt’s career, she was able to showcase her vibrant energy. Her natural charm added dimension to her character. The role of Shanaya was a start to Bhatt’s promising career in the film industry. After her debut, Bhatt received many more promising roles. For example, Bhatt played the role of Vera Tripathi in Imtiaz Ali’s 2014 film Highway . Vera Tripathi was a young girl who developed PTSD and Stockholm syndrome from being abducted and has now found freedom. This role required Bhatt to showcase her abilities in conveying a variety of emotions. Bhatt had to show emotions ranging from vulnerability to strength and resilience. This helped Bhatt’s career, as she became known for being able to take on complex and emotionally demanding roles. Bhatt’s role in Highway established the fact that Bhatt is a powerhouse performer. In addition to starring in Highway , Bhatt played a role in the movie 2 States . This is a 2014 film directed by Abhishek Verman. Bhatt played the role of Ananya Swaminathan. Ananya Swaminathan is a South Indian woman who is in love with a Punjabi man. Bhatt was able to bring this character to life and show the complexity of Ananya through her acting. This role further helped move Alia Bhatt’s career and steered it towards the right direction. It helped her make a big name for herself and advance her career as a leading actress. Although Alia Bhatt had many important and career-defining roles in her earlier years of acting, she played her career-defining roles in 2016. These roles shaped Bhatt’s acting skills and allowed her to reach her full potential as an actress. She starred in three critically acclaimed films. Her first film was Kapoor and Sons which was directed by Shakun Batra. Bhatt played the role of Tia Malik. Tia Malik is a woman who found herself stuck in a love triangle, and is a very complex character with a multitude of emotions and experiences. Playing the role of Tia Malik was different from Bhatt’s previous roles. She needed to perform a wider range of emotions. However, she was able to give a flawless performance that gave her character nuance and charm. Her performance of Tia Malik nominated Bhatt for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. The Filmfare awards are given by Filmfare in part of their annual Filmfare Awards to recognize important Hindi films and actors. Although Bhatt did not win a Filmfare Award for her performance of Tia Malik, she received the award numerous times for her portrayal of other characters. In 2016, Alia Bhatt received a role in the movie Udta Punjab , directed by Abhishek Chaubey. Bhatt played the role of Kumari Pinky, a Bihari immigrant struggling with drug addiction. This role required Bhatt to express many different emotions. This is also a very nostalgic and significant role for Bhatt. She recently shared an Instagram story with a throwback video sharing many clips of her role in the movie. She showed her love for the role and her co-stars. Bhatt’s performance in Dear Zindagi was also remarkable. Dear Zindagi is a 2016 film directed by Gauri Shinde. This movie portrays a young woman who is receiving g uidance from a psychologist. Bhatt gained worldwide recognition for her role in this film. Her ability to connect to the audience through her acting was truly displayed in this film. This became what set Bhatt apart from the rest of the industry. Recently Bhatt has taken on more challenging roles.

In a world where celebrity often fades as quickly as it arrives, Alia Bhatt stands apart—a rare blend of brilliance, resolve, and authenticity. Born on 15 March 1993 in Mumbai to filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and actress Soni Razdan, she grew up surrounded by the pulse of cinema. But it was her own conviction, not her surname, that shaped her ascent. Her journey—from a child actor in Sangharsh (1999) to a global icon—is a narrative steeped in courage, curiosity, and an unwavering pursuit of meaning. The Rise of a Star Alia Bhatt’s lead debut in Student of the Year (2012) may have been dressed in gloss, but it offered early glimpses of her magnetism. Over the next decade, she carved a space defined not by predictability but by provocation, seeking roles that tested conventions and offered something more than entertainment. Her performance in Highway (2014), as a young woman confronting the trauma of childhood abuse, marked a seismic shift. It earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress (Critics) and introduced a voice that refused to play safe. Then came Udta Punjab (2016), where she embodied the vulnerability and raw resilience of a migrant labourer ensnared in Punjab’s drug crisis—one of her most celebrated roles to date. In Raazi (2018), she brought to life the inner world of a young Indian spy married into a Pakistani military family. The film’s tension rested almost entirely on her shoulders, and she delivered with a quiet force. Gully Boy (2019) saw her portray a fiercely independent medical student, while Gangubai Kathiawadi (2022) elevated her stature to that of a national treasure. As the matriarch of Kamathipura’s red-light district turned advocate for women’s rights, she offered a performance rich in strength and nuance, earning her the National Film Award for Best Actress. Through each of these roles, Alia has shattered the idea that mainstream cinema and meaningful storytelling must remain separate. She has built a repertoire that challenges the audience to think—and feel—more deeply. Her creative ambition goes beyond acting. In 2022, she founded Eternal Sunshine Productions, her independent banner. Darlings, a dark comedy and the company’s debut, showcased her dual talents as both actor and producer. Its success paved the way for Poacher, a gripping Amazon Prime series that drew acclaim for its unflinching look at illegal wildlife trafficking. Next in line is Jigra (2024), a film she co-produces and headlines, proving she remains an unrelenting force in the evolution of Indian cinema. Leading with Vision Alia Bhatt’s influence reaches well beyond the silver screen. She is a modern entrepreneur whose ventures are underpinned by sustainability, ethical innovation, and female empowerment. In 2020, she founded Ed-a-Mamma, a conscious clothing label for children and maternity wear. Centred on organic cotton, recycled fibres, and planet-friendly packaging, the brand offers more than fashion —it fosters environmental awareness in young families. Ed-a-Mamma’s storytelling-led approach to clothing resonated with parents seeking values-aligned choices. The brand’s recognition by PETA India as Best Vegan Kidswear Brand in 2021 was followed by a significant acquisition by Reliance Retail in 2023, which secured a 51 percent stake and elevated the brand’s national reach. Alia’s investment choices reflect a commitment to nurturing homegrown innovation. Her backing of Nykaa in 2020 brought attention to India’s thriving direct-to-consumer beauty sector, while her support of Phool.co, a sustainable startup transforming temple flowers into eco-products, reinforces her focus on community upliftment. She has also supported StyleCracker, India’s first personal styling platform, and collaborated with VIP Industries in 2018 to release a line of stylish yet accessible handbags. In 2024, she authored Ed Finds a Home, her first children’s book, inspired by her brand’s mascot, Ed. The picture book gently weaves themes of environmental care, empathy, and finding one’s place in the world—a story both deeply personal and universally relatable. A Heart for Change Alia Bhatt’s voice carries influence—but more importantly, it carries intention. She has long been an advocate for animal rights, and her ongoing work with PETA India includes campaigns against animal cruelty in the fashion and entertainment industries. She was named PETA India’s Person of the Year in 2021 for her continued efforts to promote compassionate choices. In 2017, she launched CoExist, an initiative to promote coexistence between humans and animals, with campaigns that range from street animal care to urban tree conservation. She has promoted the use of sustainable accessories made from upcycled materials and conducted awareness drives on India’s declining green cover.

Dressed in a white vest, sunshine yellow bomber jacket and denims, you could mistake the 29-year-old for a teen. Except that we are in the presence of ‘India’s new acting superstar’, a term India Today had first coined for her now boyfriend of five years, Ranbir Kapoor, in 2013. That label sits well on Alia too today, but then, she, as always, likes to play it cool. “I have to observe, without it seeming like acting,” she says, of her Perk shoot, but it may well be her life’s credo. The chocolate is one of 23 brands the actor currently endorses. There cannot be a better fit for their brand, believes Monosij Bandyopadhyay, category marketing manager, chocolates, at Mondelez International, given her “girl-next-door image” and “immense popularity with teens and young adults”. advertisement One such admirer happens to be on set. Twenty-four-year-old actor Deep Jangid beams as he is introduced to his co-star, Alia. He recently watched Gangubai Kathiawadi in cinemas, and it has left him a fan of ‘Alia Ma’am’. “Do you think I can ask her for a photograph?” he asks, after the shoot wraps. Petite in frame, Alia can appear larger than life on screen. It’s hard to take your eyes off her in Gangubai, Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s biopic of the mafia queen of Kamatipura. She fills the screen with her presence, and her raspy delivery of dialogue speaks of an assuredness that comes naturally to seasoned actors. Gangubai... has catapulted her into elite stardom, with a clip of a little girl dolled up in Gangubai’s trademark white, emulating Alia’s bossy body language and reciting a dialogue going viral on social media. Enough to sting the once ‘Queen’ of Bollywood Kangana Ranaut into declaring that Gangubai is a bad influence on children. Too bad. A month after its release, Gangubai... is still running in cinemas and has grossed over Rs 122 crore so far. With it, Alia becomes the first female actor to have two heroine-fronted films (the other being Raazi, 2018) enter the Rs 100 crore league. Alia also appears in a small cameo in SS Rajamouli’s RRR, her first pan-Indian release. The film, she says, thanks to the visionary filmmaker behind it, gives her a toehold in the southern and international markets. The Hindi version of the period action drama alone has earned Rs 106 crore in five days. Alia was 20 when she first made an impression in her second film (as an adult actor)the Imtiaz Ali-directed Highwayin 2012. She has done 13 other films since. And Raazi and Gangubai are not her only films to breach the Rs 100 crore mark. 2 States [2014], a romantic comedy based on Chetan Bhagat’s novel, was her first film to gross more than Rs 100 crore. In 2017, Badrinath Ki Dulhania, in which she plays a perky yet marriage-shy graduate opposite Varun Dhawan, delivered Rs 114 crore. Alia came into her own with Raazi [2018], in which she plays an Indian spy. The film grossed Rs 122 crore. In Gully Boy [2019], Alia needed all of eight scenes to leave a lasting impression as a feisty girlfriend to Ranveer Singh’s aspiring rapper from the slums. The film earned Rs 134 crore. Among her contemporaries, Deepika Padukone is the only one who comes close to her sustained success. advertisement But throw these numbers at her, and Alia shrugs them off. She is ‘Paul the Octopus’, as Zoya Akhtar calls her, whose instinct for scripts rarely goes wrong. “What one needed to do, one has done,” says Alia. “After that, you sit back, and wait for the results.” And those results have largely been positive, a privilege few female actors of her generation can boast of. THE METHOD BEHIND THE GENIUS Ask the directors who have collaborated with her, and they commend the effort Alia puts into bringing her characters alive. For Gangubai, which is likely to fetch her more trophy ware early next year, Bhansali didn’t want Alia to visit Kamatipura, Mumbai’s red light neighbourhood. He wanted her to walk into it, much like Ganga, the aspiring actor, had in the ’50s. For homework, Alia watched Pakeezah, Mandi, Memoirs of a Geisha and Born into Brothels, Zana Briski and Raus Koffman’s award-winning documentary on Sonagachi. “I am not the kind of actor who sits down and takes notes,” says Alia of her process. advertisement It also helped that in an industry that worships the hero, Bhansali ceded the stage to his heroine, endowing Gangubai with flair, a devil-may-care demeanour and an attitude reminiscent of the leading men of the 1970s.

Even though her father is famous Alia says she grew up simply without a lot of of luxuries. Her mother mostly raised her and her siblings because their father didn't spend much time with them. Speaking about her childhood, Alia has stated, \"I had a rather grounded and modest upbringing. I didn't get the pleasures that people assume I would've got because I am Mahesh Bhatt's daughter.\" Soni Razdan was born on 25th October 1956 in Birmingham United Kingdom. She is of Kashmiri Pandit and German heritage. Razdan moved to India and started her career in the early 1980s. She played various roles in Hindi movies and television serials.

As Shanaya, a stylish and popular high school girl, Alia was able to embrace youthful glamour and effortlessly reach a younger audience. While the role was frivolous compared to later performances, it launched her onto the scene as a promising newcomer with strong screen power. The movie's box office performance gave her a star-making debut, inviting more challenging roles. It was the beginning of her journey from teen sensation to all-around actress. In 'Highway', Alia shocked audiences in the character of kidnapped Veera on her wedding night; instead of feeling fear, Veera associates captivity with freedom, regarding her travel through the \"dark underbelly\" of highways and desolate land as a type of freedom in captivity. Alia's ability to portray Veera's trauma, innocence, and ultimate joy was incredible, and this film represented a career shift for Alia. The role built a bedrock of her potential as an actress willing to break the so-called confines of conventional performances and leading to future powerhouse performances. One of Alia's boldest performances came with 'Udta Punjab' as Mary Jane, a migrant worker wanting to become a hockey player. Alia's role underwent a tremendous physical and emotional transformation as Mary Jane's journey is marked by severe exploitation and entrapment by Punjab's drug crisis. Critics and audiences praised Alia for her fearlessness in portraying anguish, tenacity, and hope even amidst the hopelessness of the situation. Alia delivered a career-defining performance that demonstrated she was fully capable of taking on socially-charged, complex narratives, with incredible depth. In 'Raazi', Alia Bhatt played the character of Sehmat, a young Indian woman who marries into a Pakistani military family to become an effective spy during the 1971 war. Yet the performance was remarkable because it was not just about Sehmat’s patriotism—it was about her internal struggle of forming emotional connections, on the other side of the enemy line. Alia balanced modesty and subtlety in her expressions, stifled her natural outgoing dialogue delivery, and yet displayed understated strength. Alia propelled the movie forward through her performance, and it was a commercial and critical success, not least because of Alia's strength, but also her likability. She proved her ability as a leading, gravitas-filled character, filled from the inside and not outside, movie character. In 'Gully Boy', Alia Bhatt set things ablaze with her portrayal of Safeena, the possessive and yet extremely loyal girlfriend. 'Safeena' was hardly the film's star character, even though Ranveer Singh's Murad acts along the lines of the story. But Alia, with her quick wit and fiery temper was able to ensure that Safeena would leave a hosanna upon the audience; through her assertive ambition and underlying self-confident strength; with incredible comic timing and emotional extremes, she showed a different idea of strength. Alia proved that even an edge role would make the audience feel any presence heavier than the last full 1 hour of Gully Boy plus and minus. Arguably her most iconic portrayal, 'Gangubai Kathiawadi' saw Alia take on the role of a powerful brothel madam who rises from traumatic beginnings to have power as a voice for marginalized women. Written and directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Alia had the challenge of conveying the vulnerability, resilience, and relentless authority of the character. With moving monologues and bombastic visual displays, Alia poured every ounce of herself into Gangubai, which made her one of Bollywood's most unforgettable characters. Critics applauded the performance as her career-defining role, one that transitioned her stature from star to bona fide powerhouse performer capable of carrying an epic on her shoulders. In Karan Johar's visually rich family drama 'Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani', Alia played Rani, a journalist who represents confidence, glamour, and progressive ambition. The role allowed Alia to converge romance, comedy, and drama all within the confines of family, tradition, and individuality. What transpired was Alia's command of the actor's archetype, blending star power with imagined emotional beats. She had stunning chemistry with Ranveer Singh, and had riveting moments entirely solo that were aware, present in a depth of determination. It cements Alia as a modern superstar that balances mass appeal while still telling forward-thinking stories.", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/alia-bhatts-versatile-roles-that-showcase-her-rise-as-a-modern-superstar/photostory/123523851.cms", "domain": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 4561}, {"source_number": 15, "title": "Simple English Wikipedia Alia Bhatt - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "snippet": "May 29, 2025 - Alia Bhatt Kapoor born and known professionally as Alia Bhatt primarily appears in Bollywood films .

In many ways (some of which become apparent in this article), they are absolutely made for each other: Ronaldo is just about the most famous footballer in the world and Morgan can possibly say the same as an interviewer. He’s certainly the go-to person (with an honourable mention for Sean Evans) for the stars. Advertisement The pair last sat down together three years ago, a genuinely explosive interview in which Ronaldo went two-footed on his then-club Manchester United and then-manager Erik ten Hag, saying he had no respect for the Dutchman. This time around , we find Ronaldo in a reflective mood as he approaches the end of his career with Al Nassr and Portugal. The chat takes place in his “man cave” in his Saudi Arabian home and, after some banter about the Premier League title hopes of Arsenal, the club Morgan supports, the pair get into what Ronaldo is calling his “most personal interview”. “This time, I promise I’m going to be a good man,” Ronaldo states as Morgan cackles. Al Nassr manager Jorge Jesus is safe, then. Manchester United Ronaldo is sad about their decline. This interview was recorded weeks ago, before United actually managed to beat their bogey team , Brighton & Hove Albion, and enjoy a relatively normal period of stability. In general, of course, United are light years away from the success they had when Ronaldo was there (the first time). “Manchester United, right now, they don’t have a structure,” Ronaldo says. “I hope that changes in the future, because the potential of the club is amazing, it’s one of the most important clubs of the century. “They’re not on a good path. They need to change and it’s not only about the coach and players…” Ronaldo is cut off by Morgan at this point as he’s potentially about to tear into United co-owner INEOS . Morgan instead interjects with a question about head coach Ruben Amorim, a fellow Portuguese. “He’s doing his best,” Ronaldo replies. “What are you going to do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible.” As we said, this was before they performed the Brighton miracle. Ronaldo the billionaire Almost 20 per cent of the interview is taken up by Ronaldo talking about how rich he is. Advertisement At the time of recording, it had just been reported (according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index) that he had become the first billionaire footballer. “I was the one who told you, because I messaged you and said, ‘Have you seen this?’,” says Morgan. Ronaldo basically says he already was one. “It was my goal to reach that number,” he adds. “I’m not obsessed for the money, but when you reach some level, money doesn’t matter anymore, but it’s always good to have more. He continues: “The numbers don’t lie. If you see so many records in football, ‘Cristiano is there at the top of the list, it’s one record more’, it doesn’t surprise me because I knew my potential in football and outside of football. I knew I was going to reach that number, for many reasons.” They carry on chatting about how rich he is, how many cars he has, with Ronaldo claiming he’s lost count (“I don’t want to be humble, it’s a fact”) and his most excessive purchase being an aeroplane (“I’m not a normal person, I cannot be in airports”). “You’re probably the most normal billionaire I know. We message a lot, you’re like one of my mates,” Morgan says. Retirement Despite his incredible goalscoring record in recent years (yes, it may only be in Saudi Arabia, but the numbers since Ronaldo turned 30 are remarkable), Ronaldo will not have much longer left either in Saudi Arabia or playing for Portugal. The World Cup is next summer in the United States, Canada and Mexico, offering surely the final opportunity for Ronaldo to win the greatest competition the sport has to offer. His Al Nassr contract, reported to be worth £492million ($641m) with a basic salary of £488,000 a day , runs until 2027. Will he retire from international football next summer, then? And perhaps from club football a year later? He’s not putting a date on it, but he has started to imagine it happening. Advertisement “Soon,” Ronaldo states. “But I will be prepared. It’ll be tough and difficult, of course. Probably I will cry, yes. It will be very difficult, but Piers, I have prepared for my future since 25 or 26 years old. Nothing will compare to the adrenaline we have to score a goal. But, everything has a beginning and an end, so I’ll be prepared. “I’ll have more time for me, my family, to raise my kids. I want to follow Cristiano Junior (currently playing for Portugal Under-16s) because he’s in the age where you do stupid things, normal, I did the same. “I want to be more (of a) family person, more present.” Cristiano Ronaldo Junior represents Portugal at under-16s level (Orhan Cicek/Anadolu via Get", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6777172/2025/11/04/cristiano-ronaldo-piers-moragn-takeaways/", "domain": "nytimes.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 6897}, {"source_number": 2, "title": "Cristiano Ronaldo - Wikipedia", "snippet": "Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu] ⓘ; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for, and …", "full_content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Portuguese footballer (born 1985) \"CR7\" redirects here.

His 2007–08 season earned him his first Ballon d'Or at age 23. In 2009, Ronaldo became the subject of the then- most expensive transfer in history when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €94 million (£80 million). At Madrid, he was at the forefront of the club's resurgence as a dominant European force, helping them win four Champions Leagues between 2014 and 2018, including the long-awaited La Décima .

Explore the latest updates on his current contract status, future plans, and expert predictions on the legendary striker’s career timeline.", "full_content": "In the pantheon of all-time soccer greats, Cristiano Ronaldo is often counted among the very best— and some even argue he’s the greatest. A five-time Ballon d’Or winner and the sport’s all-time leading goal scorer, Ronaldo has been a global icon for more than two decades, lighting up every club he’s played for, from Manchester United to Real Madrid , Juventus, and now Al-Nassr. For his country, Portugal, he has rewritten the record books and helped capture major trophies, surpassing legends like Eusébio and becoming the defining figure of Portuguese soccer. But all legends face the inevitable question: when will the curtain fall? Now in his 40s, Ronaldo’s remarkable career has continued to defy time, yet retirement looms on the horizon. Here, we explore when Ronaldo might finally hang up his boots and what he’s said about his future. Has Cristiano Ronaldo Announced When He’ll Retire? Cristiano Ronaldo recently signed a new deal with Al-Nassr. / X/Al Nassr FC No, Cristiano Ronaldo has not announced when he will retire. In fact, he’s done quite the opposite. In June 2025, amid widespread speculation about his future, the Portuguese icon signed a new two-year contract with Al-Nassr that will keep him at the club until 2027—after his 42nd birthday. “A new chapter begins. Same passion, same dream. Let’s make history together,” Ronaldo wrote on social media while announcing the deal, which reportedly pays him $670,000 per day, or $4.67 million per week, totaling $245 million annually. While Ronaldo isn’t planning to stop playing anytime soon, just before signing the new contract, he acknowledged that age is catching up with him, though he stopped short of giving a retirement timeline. “You know how old I am already. I’m closer to the end than I was at the beginning, but I have to enjoy every moment. If I don’t get seriously injured, I’ll keep going,” he said. Given a paycheck like that, it’s easy to see why Ronaldo isnt' calling it time just yet. How Is Ronaldo Performing as He Nears Retirement? Cristiano Ronaldo. / IMAGO/Naushad Cristiano Ronaldo continues to defy age with his impressive performances on both the domestic and international stage. Since joining Al-Nassr in 2023, he has scored 99 goals in 111 appearances for the Saudi Pro League side—a remarkable form that’s brought him closer to the elusive 1,000-goal milestone, a feat unprecedented in soccer history. For Portugal, Ronaldo remains the team's key player. Most recently, he helped his country secure its second UEFA Nations League title, scoring in a thrilling 2-2 draw against Spain before Portugal won on penalties. Known for his strict diet, intense workout routine, and relentless dedication to self-improvement on and off the pitch, Ronaldo’s lifestyle clearly continues to pay off as he enters his twilight years—especially as many of his contemporaries have long since called it quits. Predicting Ronaldo’s Retirement Date Cristiano Ronaldo is still Portugal's main man. / IMAGO/Nico Herbertz With a fresh two-year contract at Al-Nassr, it’s safe to bet Ronaldo won’t be calling it quits before 2027—unless something unexpected happens, like a serious injury or personal change. His second stint at Manchester United at age 36 proved he still has the hunger and drive to compete at the highest level. But after spending a few years in the Saudi league and with age inevitably catching up, it’s likely he’ll wind down his career somewhere less intense—whether that’s back home at Sporting Lisbon, in Major League Soccer, or continuing to dominate in Saudi Arabia. Don’t count him out just yet, though. Ronaldo is known for chasing historic milestones, and with the 1,000-goal mark within sight, plus those eye-watering paychecks, he could keep defying expectations well beyond 2027. After all, legends don’t retire quietly—they make sure their final chapters are unforgettable.

So I can prove that [they happened].\" The former United and Real Madrid ace also hinted at plans to see his career out at Al-Nassr. \"I don't know if I will retire soon, in two or three years, but probably I will retire here at Al-Nassr,\" he told Portuguese outlet Now. \"I'm happy at this club.

It sent waves through the football community when Ronaldo confirmed that Euro 2024, currently ongoing in Germany, would be his final appearance in the prestigious tournament. This news comes after Portugal’s hard-fought victory over Slovenia in the round of 16, where Ronaldo himself failed to score but remained dedicated to his team. Here are all the details that you need to know: Cristiano Ronaldo’s retirement could be imminent, as his recent statement following the Portugal versus Slovenia match shocked the football world. ‘Viva Ronaldo’ cheers erupted during the post-match ceremony after Portugal triumphed in the round of 16 through penalties. In the Euro 2024 quarter-finals, Ronaldo’s Portuguese team faced Kylian Mbappe’s France. Cristiano Ronaldo, the captain of Portugal, said toRTP on Mondaythat this would be his final European Championship. “It is, without doubt, my last European Championship. But I’m not emotional about that. I’m moved by all that football means, by the enthusiasm I have for the game, the enthusiasm for seeing my supporters, my family, the affection people have for me,” Ronaldo stated following Portugal’s improbable 3-0 victory over Slovenia on penalties, advancing them to the quarterfinal. Ronaldo has not had the best tournament, as he failed to find the net in any of his four games this tournament. When Portugal got a penalty during extra time in their round of 16 match against Slovenia, he had an excellent chance to score his first goal. However, Jan Oblak performed an amazing save and prevented the Al Nassr player from scoring a goal. Portugal and Slovenia battled it out until the final moments, but neither of the teams managed to score, leading to a penalty shootout. Portugal, known for their composure in high-pressure situations, emerged victorious with a remarkable3-0 victory by penalties. However, the most surprising moment of the game came when Ronaldo missed his penalty kick, with Jan Oblak making an outstanding save, bringing an end to Ronaldo’s impressive penalty record. This appeared to stir his emotions, as he was seen shedding tears. After the game ended, Ronaldo said it was his final UEFA Euro event. He was also seen overwhelmed, getting emotional, and being comforted by teammates on the field. Reactions reverberated throughout the football world after Cristiano Ronaldo’s failure to convert a pivotal penalty during Portugal’s Euro 2024 qualifier against Slovenia. Fans were quick to voice their opinions on various social media platforms, with a multitude conveying frustration and disappointment. The global fanbase, in unison, ignited social media platforms with their fervent responses. Several fans expressed their criticism openly, as one user remarked, “He needs to retire and give Jota and many other young talents time to play at their prime.” This viewpoint resonated with numerous others who believed that the 38-year-old may have surpassed his peak. The inevitable comparisons to his longstanding adversary Lionel Messi emerged, exemplified by statements such as “I love him, but I won’t shy away from saying he’s running out of steam,”. Every great player experiences moments of criticism, yet Ronaldo perseveres with unwavering support from asteadfast group of loyal fans. They firmly believe in his enduring potential and firmly assert that a solitary missed penalty should not diminish his invaluable contributions. “We will never see another player that has inspired every single young footballer and the next generation in our lifetime.

Both Ronaldo and Morgan teased the conversation on their respective YouTube channels on Tuesday, releasing the first part of the interview along with a short preview of what’s to come in part two — whose release date has not yet been confirmed. Morgan asked the Portuguese star about a message he wrote to Trump when signing a shirt gifted to the U.S. president last June by European Council President António Costa. The shirt read: “For President Donald Trump. Playing for peace.” Ronaldo replied simply: “He’s one of the guys that can help to change the world.” Part Two: Reflections, Loss, and the Future According to the preview, the second part of the interview will feature the Al Nassr forward reflecting on his past and speaking emotionally about the death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota, who tragically passed away this summer in a car accident in Spain alongside his brother. The forward will also discuss the upcoming World Cup in Canada, the United States, and Mexico — and what the tournament could mean for the final stretch of his career. “Retirement Will Be Hard” In the first part of the interview, Ronaldo admitted that his retirement from professional football is “coming soon” and that it will be “hard” for him. He also looked back on his time at Manchester United and shared details about his recent engagement to Spanish model and influencer Georgina Rodríguez, his partner of nearly a decade. Cristiano Ronaldo Opens Up About His Proposal to Georgina Rodríguez In a more intimate segment of the interview, Ronaldo revealed personal details about his proposal to Georgina Rodríguez — a spontaneous yet “beautiful” moment that took place over dinner. The couple, who have been together since 2016, plan to marry after the next World Cup. Georgina Rodríguez and Cristiano Ronaldo Instagram / @georginagio “I proposed because it felt like the right moment — not just because she’s the mother of my children, but because she’s the person I love the most, the love of my life,” Ronaldo said. He recalled how Georgina had long dreamed of a special engagement ring. “She told me she wanted a real stone, so I worked hard to find the one she’d love,” he said. “I asked a friend to hold onto it until dinner that night, when I planned to surprise her.” When the couple were finally alone at the table, a friend began recording — something that surprised Ronaldo. “It was strange; he hadn’t filmed me in 10 years,” he joked. Moments later, their daughters, Alana and Eva, who had already gone to bed, suddenly reappeared. “My daughters came and said, ‘Dad, are you going to give mom the ring and ask her to marry you?’ and I thought, wow — this is the moment,” Ronaldo added, explaining that he hadn’t planned it and didn’t even get down on one knee, though he spoke heartfelt words to Georgina. He described the scene as “fun and beautiful,” adding that Georgina didn’t hesitate to say yes — though she asked several times if it was “really happening.” “I always knew I’d do it one day, I just didn’t know how,” Ronaldo said. “Nothing will change because we get married — it’s simply another beautiful chapter in life.” “Yes, I Do”: Georgina’s Emotional Instagram Post On August 11, Cristiano and Georgina announced their engagement after nearly ten years together and several children in common. Rodríguez, 31, shared a photo on Instagram of their intertwined hands — hers adorned with a large diamond ring — captioned: “Yes, I do. In this and all my lives.” The couple had previously spoken about the possibility of marriage in interviews and in Georgina’s hit Netflix reality show Soy Georgina, which offered a rare glimpse into their private life. Ronaldo, now playing for Saudi club Al Nassr, and Georgina, one of Spain’s most influential figures, continue to balance their global fame with family life — and, it seems, a new chapter of love and commitment.

It's the summit of statistical greatness, a record that would redefine the limits of individual excellence in the sport. Throughout his career, the Portugal superstar has broken most of the records and won most of the trophies he could have won, but being able to officially score 1,000 goals will put him in a pantheon of his own among athletes. Ronaldo is already the leading men's international scorer with 143 goals from 225 games, while the rest of his career total of 950 goals over his two-decade career have come in the club game for Sporting CP , Manchester United , Real Madrid , Juventus and now at Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr . So, as he nears an extraordinary landmark, ESPN will track every goal on his journey toward 1,000 -- one strike at a time -- until he reaches the magic number.

Ronaldo was in fine form on Saturday as Al Nassr came back from a goal down to defeat Al Fayha at the King Fahd International Stadium. After slipping behind early, the 40-year-old latched on to a through-ball from Kingsley Coman to restore parity for the hosts in the 37th minute. Ronaldo then kept his cool to slot home the winner from the penalty spot to ensure Al Nassr kept a flawless seven-in-seven record to start the Saudi Pro League season.

The couple tied the knot in 2021 after years of dating each other, and soon becameone of the most loved couples in Bollywood. While Vicky grew up inMumbaiwith his action director father Sham Kaushal and homemaker mother Veena Kaushal, Katrina had an unconventional childhood. She grew up with single mother Suzanne Turquotte, who worked as a lawyer, but then got involved with international charity work. Her work required her to travel across many continents, and so, Katrina, along with her seven siblings travelled the world with her. Amid all this, her father was absent as he left the family when Katrina was quite young. In a 2008 interview with Shoma Chaudhury, Katrina said that her father was not an influence in her life. “My father is not an influence, he was not part of our family; my parents separated when I was very young and I have never met him since,” she said, when asked about her early years. Talking about her mother, she said, “The biggest thing I learnt from her is to be completely non-judgemental.” ALSO READ | Shah Rukh Khan, worth $1.4 bn, would say ‘kahan hai mere pass itna paisa’, recalls producer: ‘He worked hard, did ads, danced at weddings’ During these years, Katrina was in a relationship withSalman Khan, but until then, she had never spoken about it openly. Back then, at the age of 25, Katrina felt that the absence of a father figure drew her to older men. Salman was 43 at the time. “I am sure if some psychoanalyst lay me on a couch and probed hard and long, they could prove I was sad, but actually, at most, the lack of a father means I am drawn to older men, men who have lived life and have some experience,” she said. However, a few years later, Salman and Katrina broke up. She was then in a relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, which also lasted for around six years. She is now married to Vicky, who is five years younger than her. In the same chat, Katrina spoke more about her childhood as a globetrotter. As per the interview, she lived in Hong Kong, Japan, China, Ukraine, Romania, France, USA, Poland, Belgium, Austria, South Africa, England, and was homeschooled for the most part. She shared that her childhood prepared her for every kind of situation. “We never lived anywhere for more than two years and we did not have a great deal of stability, or physical security and comfort, but we led a very culturally diverse life. That’s an unbeatable way to be prepared — I don’t think you can’t get a better education than that. I have seen so much and lived in so many cultures, nothing shocks me. You can throw me anywhere and I will adapt,” she said. But, when asked about specific details about her childhood, Katrina just said, “I’ll have to ask my sister,” she says. “All I can immediately remember is being snowed in for months in Japan, and being terribly sea-sick on a long ship-ride to Europe.” Katrina has been a part of Indian films since 2003. She has been working in movies for over 22 years now and is most notably known for her work in films like Namastey London, Jab Tak Hai Jaan, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, Tiger series among many others.

One of India's highest-paid actresses, she has received various accolades , including four Screen Awards and four Zee Cine Awards , alongside three Filmfare Awards nominations. Although critical reception to her acting has varied, she is noted for her roles in action films and her dancing ability. Born in British Hong Kong , Kaif lived in several countries before moving to London , where she spent three years. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career in fashion modelling. At a fashion show in London, Indian filmmaker Kaizad Gustad cast her in Boom (2003), which was a critical and commercial failure. While Kaif established a successful modelling career in India, she initially faced difficulty securing film roles due to her limited command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film Malliswari (2004), Kaif achieved commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). Further success followed with a series of box-office hits, though she was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles, and preference for male-dominated films. Kaif's performances in the thriller New York (2009) and the romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011) were better received, earning her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress . Her career progressed with roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010), and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011). She found major commercial success in the action thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), and Bang Bang! (2014), which ranked among the highest-grossing Indian films of that decade. Following a brief setback, the action films Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), Sooryavanshi (2021), and Tiger 3 (2023), along with the drama Bharat (2019), emerged as box-office hits. Kaif's portrayal of an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama Zero (2018) earned her the Zee Cine Award for Best Supporting Actress and her performance in the mystery thriller Merry Christmas (2024) was well-received. In the media, Kaif frequently appears in listings of India’s most popular and attractive celebrities. A regular brand endorser, she launched her cosmetic line Kay Beauty in 2019. She participates in stage shows and is involved with her mother’s charity, Relief Projects India, which helps underprivileged children.

We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience ... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too ... religious? ...

Her mother is now re-settled in Chennai (formerly known as Madras), the Capital of the state of Tamil Nadu in India. She spent subsequent years in Hawaii, and then in London, Britain, She started modeling accidentally when she was in Hawaii at the tender age of 14, when she was approached for a jewelry campaign. Thereafter she continued modeling in London. Continuing to model was the reason she got her break in a Bollywood movie Boom (2003) offered by none other than film-maker Kaizad Gustad. She was flooded with modeling assignments the minute she set her foot on Indian soil, especially with her innocent expressive face, hour-glass figure, and drop-dead gorgeous looks. Professionally she started off as a model with photographer Atul Kasbekar, and upon being accepted, she received offers from LG, Cola, Fevicol, Lakme, & Veet. It was the Lakme commercial that got her noticed. She retained Matrix as her Manager to accept work on her behalf and at the price she deserved. Moving to different culture and country was not much of a culture shock for her, as she states that no matter where you come from, the bottom line is that everyone wants to be loved, respected, and cared for. Despite of her positive attitude, she had been stereotyped as \"Indian\" by extreme right-wingers in Britain who made it clear that she did not quite fit-in with their \"Blonde\" Caucasian culture; while on the other hand in India itself she had been ranked as an 'outsider' very much like Sonia Gandhi. Unlike other artistes from foreign lands, Katrina did not experience any difficulties in getting a visa nor of getting it extended in India. Although linguistically challenged, Katrina puts on a bold face and states that other Bollywood artistes like Sridevi, who did not know Hindi, did get offers from Bollywood film-makers, and she is no different. She has taken Hindi and dancing lessons to fit in with the Bollywood culture. She likes to display a picture of her learning Kathak dancing where she used to dance 7 hours a day non-stop. Adorned with soft gorgeous looks, she is not easily intimidated, but admits that she is very emotional, sensitive, and concerned about her privacy, Almost an incurable romantic, she prefers to wear comfortable non-revealing clothes when at home, hates to do her hair, and above all dislikes make-up. Admitting to being lonely in the beginning, but now has several friends who she can hang out with. Although her first movie Boom (2003) was panned by the critics and shunned by the audiences, two other Telugu movies Malliswari (2004) and Allari Pidugu (2005) did get her noticed. She grossed 70 Lakh Rupees for Malliswari (2004) - making her top the list of the highest paid actresses during a South Indian movie debut. Not done with South Indian movies, she has been signed in a Tamil movie 'Bheema' opposite National Award Winner Vikram. She has received decent reviews for her part in \"Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya\", as well as a brief appearance in 'Sarkar'. Katrina had made Mumbai her base, didn't mind singing and dancing around trees and as a result is now one of the biggest mega-stars, perhaps one of the highest paid female-lead actresses in Bollywood, and a crowd-puller whenever she makes an appearance for a live song and dance number.

It is due to her place of birth, She was born and raised in London. The opposite of &quot;mother tongue&quot; is &quot;foreign language,&quot; which refers to a language that is not one's native or first language. Katrina Kaif's mother is British and her father is of British and Kashmiri descent. Her father, Mohammed Kaif, hails from Kashmir, India. Mother tongue is important because it is the first language a person learns and is closely tied to one's cultural identity and sense of belonging. Proficiency in one's mother tongue can also facilitate cognitive development and learning of additional languages. Preserving and promoting the use of mother tongues is essential for maintaining linguistic diversity and preserving heritage. If the mother is homozygous for the ability to roll her tongue (TT) and the father is homozygous for the inability to roll his tongue (tt), all their offspring will inherit one dominant allele (T) from the mother and one recessive allele (t) from the father. As a result, all children will have the genotype Tt, which means they will all be able to roll their tongues. Thus, every child will express the dominant trait of tongue rolling.

The couple tied the knot in 2021 after years of dating each other, and soon becameone of the most loved couples in Bollywood. While Vicky grew up inMumbaiwith his action director father Sham Kaushal and homemaker mother Veena Kaushal, Katrina had an unconventional childhood. She grew up with single mother Suzanne Turquotte, who worked as a lawyer, but then got involved with international charity work. Her work required her to travel across many continents, and so, Katrina, along with her seven siblings travelled the world with her. Amid all this, her father was absent as he left the family when Katrina was quite young.

Talking about her mother, she said, “The biggest thing I learnt from her is to be completely non-judgemental.” During these years, Katrina was in a relationship withSalman Khan, but until then, she had never spoken about it openly. Back then, at the age of 25, Katrina felt that the absence of a father figure drew her to older men. Salman was 43 at the time. “I am sure if some psychoanalyst lay me on a couch and probed hard and long, they could prove I was sad, but actually, at most, the lack of a father means I am drawn to older men, men who have lived life and have some experience,” she said. However, a few years later, Salman and Katrina broke up. She was then in a relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, which also lasted for around six years. She is now married to Vicky, who is five years younger than her.

As per the interview, she lived in Hong Kong, Japan, China, Ukraine, Romania, France, USA, Poland, Belgium, Austria, South Africa, England, and was homeschooled for the most part. She shared that her childhood prepared her for every kind of situation. “We never lived anywhere for more than two years and we did not have a great deal of stability, or physical security and comfort, but we led a very culturally diverse life. That’s an unbeatable way to be prepared — I don’t think you can’t get a better education than that. I have seen so much and lived in so many cultures, nothing shocks me. You can throw me anywhere and I will adapt,” she said. But, when asked about specific details about her childhood, Katrina just said, “I’ll have to ask my sister,” she says. “All I can immediately remember is being snowed in for months in Japan, and being terribly sea-sick on a long ship-ride to Europe.” Katrina has been a part of Indian films since 2003. She has been working in movies for over 22 years now and is most notably known for her work in films like Namastey London, Jab Tak Hai Jaan, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, Tiger series among many others.

Many people carry forward the lessons, strengths, and even the voids they felt growing up, shaping the kind of parents they aspire to be. In a 2019 interview withFilmfare,Katrina Kaif, who welcomed a baby boy with Vicky Kaushal on November 7,reflected on her upbringingand how it influenced her vision of family. She shared, “Not having a father figure does create a certain vacuum and makes any girl feel vulnerable. When I have kids, I want them to have the experience of being with both parents.” She also admitted that moments of emotional struggle made her long for paternal support, saying, “Each time I’ve gone through something emotionally hard, I was compelled to reflect that it must be nice for those who have a strong fatherly support from a male figure, who loves you unconditionally.” Raised by her mother, Suzanne Turquotte, alongside seven siblings, Katrina once asked her how she managed the responsibility alone. “I asked her, ‘What were you thinking when you had so many children, and how did you do it on your own?’ But in the last few years, what my mom had to say about life has been much more helpful to me. It bears more weight. Now that you can see things from a distance, you realise it must have been tough for her.” Sonal Khangarot, a licensed rehabilitation counsellor and psychotherapist, tellsindianexpress.com, “Growing up without one parent, especially a father figure, can deeply shape a child’s inner world. Fathers often serve as both protectors and role models, so their absence may create a gap in thechild’s sense of securityand belonging. Many children in such situations grapple with heightened vulnerability—they may question their worth, feel abandoned, or worry about stability in relationships later in life. This can manifest as anxiety, self-doubt, or a tendency to either over-depend on others or become overly self-reliant.” At the same time, she notes that children are incredibly resilient. “With consistent care, love, and guidance from the remaining parent or extended family, they can still grow into emotionally strong individuals. What matters most is whether their emotional needs are acknowledged and nurtured.” Khangarot states that for some, this means offering their children the love, security, or opportunities they missed, which can be deeply healing and help them rewrite their own narratives. “The benefit is that they often become more empathetic and intentional in their parenting. However, the challenge lies in overcompensation—projecting their unmet needs onto their children or parenting from a place of fear. The healthiest approach is self-awareness: recognising what was lacking, while allowing their child’s needs to guide their parenting,” she mentions. For single parents, Khangarot explains that the key is creating a consistent environment where children feel loved, safe, and valued. Maintaining routines provides stability, while involving extended family or trusted mentors can give children additional role models. It’s also important for single parents to prioritise their own well-being; emotionally regulated parents raiseemotionally secure children. Instead of focusing on what’s missing, highlighting strengths within the family unit helps children develop resilience.

One of India's highest-paid actresses, she has received various accolades , including four Screen Awards and four Zee Cine Awards , alongside three Filmfare Awards nominations. Although critical reception to her acting has varied, she is noted for her roles in action films and her dancing ability. Born in British Hong Kong , Kaif lived in several countries before moving to London , where she spent three years. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career in fashion modelling. At a fashion show in London, Indian filmmaker Kaizad Gustad cast her in Boom (2003), which was a critical and commercial failure. While Kaif established a successful modelling career in India, she initially faced difficulty securing film roles due to her limited command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film Malliswari (2004), Kaif achieved commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). Further success followed with a series of box-office hits, though she was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles, and preference for male-dominated films. Kaif's performances in the thriller New York (2009) and the romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011) were better received, earning her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress . Her career progressed with roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010), and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011). She found major commercial success in the action thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), and Bang Bang! (2014), which ranked among the highest-grossing Indian films of that decade. Following a brief setback, the action films Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), Sooryavanshi (2021), and Tiger 3 (2023), along with the drama Bharat (2019), emerged as box-office hits. Kaif's portrayal of an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama Zero (2018) earned her the Zee Cine Award for Best Supporting Actress and her performance in the mystery thriller Merry Christmas (2024) was well-received. In the media, Kaif frequently appears in listings of India’s most popular and attractive celebrities. A regular brand endorser, she launched her cosmetic line Kay Beauty in 2019. She participates in stage shows and is involved with her mother’s charity, Relief Projects India, which helps underprivileged children. Kaif is married to actor Vicky Kaushal , with whom she has a son. Early life and family Katrina Kaif was born in British Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turcotte (also spelt Turquotte), on 16 July 1983. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Her father, Mohammed Kaif, is a British businessman of Kashmiri descent and her mother, Suzanne (also spelt Susanna), is an English lawyer and charity worker. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] She has seven siblings; [ 6 ] one sister, Isabel, is also a model and actress. [ 7 ] Kaif's parents divorced when she was a child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on her or her siblings while they were growing up, and that they were raised by their mother. [ 1 ] [ 5 ] [ 8 ] In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express , she said she was not in touch with her father. [ 5 ] Kaif's paternal parentage has been questioned by some members of the film industry. [ 1 ] In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror , Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: \"We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience ... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too ... religious? ... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great\". [ 4 ] Kaif denied this, calling Shroff's comments \"hurtful\". [ 1 ] Kaif with her mother at the People's Choice Awards India , 2012 As Kaif's mother is a social activist, the family relocated to a number of countries for varying lengths of time. [ 8 ] Therefore, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled by a series of tutors. [ 9 ] She said: Our transitions in growing up were—from Hong Kong where I was born, to China, then to Japan, and from Japan by boat to France ... After France, Switzerland—and I'm cutting out many East European countries where we were for only a few months each—then Poland in Kraków ...

It is tied with Hurricane Harvey as being the costliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin . Katrina was the twelfth tropical cyclone, the fifth hurricane, the third major hurricane , and the second Category 5 hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season . It was also the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States , as measured by barometric pressure . Katrina formed on August 23, 2005, with the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of a tropical depression . After briefly strengthening to a tropical storm over south Florida, Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane before weakening to a Category 3 at its landfall on August 29 near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana . Eighty percent of New Orleans, as well as large areas in neighboring parishes , were flooded. It is estimated that about 100,000 to 150,000 people remained in the City of New Orleans, despite mandatory evacuation orders. The flooding prompted a massive national and international response effort, including federal, local, and private rescue operations. The largest loss of life was due to flooding caused by engineering flaws in the federally built hurricane protection system, particularly the levees around New Orleans. Investigators concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , tasked by Congress in the Flood Control Act of 1965 to design and build the region's hurricane protection, was responsible for the breached floodwalls . Later, a federal appeals court ruled that the Army Corps, despite being responsible, could not be held financially liable due to the Flood Control Act of 1928 . The emergency response from federal, state, and local governments was widely criticized, leading to the resignation of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) superintendent Eddie Compass . Many other government officials faced criticism for their responses, especially New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin , Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco , and President George W. Bush . However, several agencies, such as the United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Hurricane Center (NHC), and National Weather Service (NWS), were commended for their actions, with the NHC being particularly praised for its accurate forecasts well in advance. [ 1 ] The destruction and loss of life caused by the storm prompted the name Katrina to be retired by the World Meteorological Organization in April 2006. On January 4, 2023, the NHC updated the Katrina fatality data based on a 2014 report, which reduced the total number from an estimated 1,833 to 1,392.

Her mother is now re-settled in Chennai (formerly known as Madras), the Capital of the state of Tamil Nadu in India. She spent subsequent years in Hawaii, and then in London, Britain, She started modeling accidentally when she was in Hawaii at the tender age of 14, when she was approached for a jewelry campaign. Thereafter she continued modeling in London. Continuing to model was the reason she got her break in a Bollywood movie Boom (2003) offered by none other than film-maker Kaizad Gustad. She was flooded with modeling assignments the minute she set her foot on Indian soil, especially with her innocent expressive face, hour-glass figure, and drop-dead gorgeous looks. Professionally she started off as a model with photographer Atul Kasbekar, and upon being accepted, she received offers from LG, Cola, Fevicol, Lakme, & Veet. It was the Lakme commercial that got her noticed. She retained Matrix as her Manager to accept work on her behalf and at the price she deserved. Moving to different culture and country was not much of a culture shock for her, as she states that no matter where you come from, the bottom line is that everyone wants to be loved, respected, and cared for. Despite of her positive attitude, she had been stereotyped as \"Indian\" by extreme right-wingers in Britain who made it clear that she did not quite fit-in with their \"Blonde\" Caucasian culture; while on the other hand in India itself she had been ranked as an 'outsider' very much like Sonia Gandhi. Unlike other artistes from foreign lands, Katrina did not experience any difficulties in getting a visa nor of getting it extended in India. Although linguistically challenged, Katrina puts on a bold face and states that other Bollywood artistes like Sridevi, who did not know Hindi, did get offers from Bollywood film-makers, and she is no different. She has taken Hindi and dancing lessons to fit in with the Bollywood culture. She likes to display a picture of her learning Kathak dancing where she used to dance 7 hours a day non-stop. Adorned with soft gorgeous looks, she is not easily intimidated, but admits that she is very emotional, sensitive, and concerned about her privacy, Almost an incurable romantic, she prefers to wear comfortable non-revealing clothes when at home, hates to do her hair, and above all dislikes make-up. Admitting to being lonely in the beginning, but now has several friends who she can hang out with. Although her first movie Boom (2003) was panned by the critics and shunned by the audiences, two other Telugu movies Malliswari (2004) and Allari Pidugu (2005) did get her noticed. She grossed 70 Lakh Rupees for Malliswari (2004) - making her top the list of the highest paid actresses during a South Indian movie debut. Not done with South Indian movies, she has been signed in a Tamil movie 'Bheema' opposite National Award Winner Vikram. She has received decent reviews for her part in \"Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya\", as well as a brief appearance in 'Sarkar'. Katrina had made Mumbai her base, didn't mind singing and dancing around trees and as a result is now one of the biggest mega-stars, perhaps one of the highest paid female-lead actresses in Bollywood, and a crowd-puller whenever she makes an appearance for a live song and dance number. - IMDb mini biography by: rAjOo Family Spouse Vicky Kaushal (December 9, 2021 - Present) Parents Suzanne Turquotte Mohammed Kaif Relatives Isabelle Kaif (Sibling) Trademarks Statuesque, model-like figure.

(Image courtesy: @katrinakaif/Instagram) India Today Entertainment Desk New Delhi , UPDATED: Sep 23, 2025 17:55 IST On September 23, 2025, Katrina Kaif shared the happy news of her pregnancy. Long before becoming one of Bollywood’s most celebrated stars, she had spoken about the quiet struggles of her childhood – growing up in a single-parent home and how the absence of a father shaped her views on family. In a 2019 interview with Filmfare , the actor opened up about what she wants for her own children. Brought up by her mother, Suzanne Turquotte, after her parents separated, Katrina admitted, “Not having a father figure does create a certain vacuum and makes any girl feel vulnerable. When I have kids, I want them to have the experience of being with both parents.” advertisement She confessed that difficult times often made her long for the comfort of paternal support. “Each time I’ve gone through something emotionally hard, I was compelled to reflect that it must be nice for those who have a strong fatherly support from a male figure, who loves you unconditionally,” she said. Katrina, one of eight siblings, also recalled asking her mother how she managed to raise such a large family on her own. “I asked her what were you thinking when you had so many children, and how did you do it on your own? But in the last few years, what my mum had to say about life has been much more helpful to me. It bears more weight. Now that you can see things from a distance, you realise it must have been tough for her,” she reflected. The resurfaced comments come at a time when Katrina and her husband, actor Vicky Kaushal , announced that they are expecting their first child. On Tuesday, the couple shared a heartfelt picture of Vicky caressing his pregnant wife's baby bump, with the caption, \"On our way to start the best chapter of our lives with hearts full of joy and gratitude (sic).\" Here's the picture: Katrina and Vicky got married in December 2021 at Six Senses Fort Barwara, Rajasthan, in an intimate wedding attended only by close family and friends.

The couple tied the knot in 2021 after years of dating each other, and soon becameone of the most loved couples in Bollywood. While Vicky grew up inMumbaiwith his action director father Sham Kaushal and homemaker mother Veena Kaushal, Katrina had an unconventional childhood. She grew up with single mother Suzanne Turquotte, who worked as a lawyer, but then got involved with international charity work. Her work required her to travel across many continents, and so, Katrina, along with her seven siblings travelled the world with her. Amid all this, her father was absent as he left the family when Katrina was quite young.

Talking about her mother, she said, “The biggest thing I learnt from her is to be completely non-judgemental.” During these years, Katrina was in a relationship withSalman Khan, but until then, she had never spoken about it openly. Back then, at the age of 25, Katrina felt that the absence of a father figure drew her to older men. Salman was 43 at the time. “I am sure if some psychoanalyst lay me on a couch and probed hard and long, they could prove I was sad, but actually, at most, the lack of a father means I am drawn to older men, men who have lived life and have some experience,” she said. However, a few years later, Salman and Katrina broke up. She was then in a relationship with Ranbir Kapoor, which also lasted for around six years. She is now married to Vicky, who is five years younger than her.

As per the interview, she lived in Hong Kong, Japan, China, Ukraine, Romania, France, USA, Poland, Belgium, Austria, South Africa, England, and was homeschooled for the most part. She shared that her childhood prepared her for every kind of situation. “We never lived anywhere for more than two years and we did not have a great deal of stability, or physical security and comfort, but we led a very culturally diverse life. That’s an unbeatable way to be prepared — I don’t think you can’t get a better education than that. I have seen so much and lived in so many cultures, nothing shocks me. You can throw me anywhere and I will adapt,” she said. But, when asked about specific details about her childhood, Katrina just said, “I’ll have to ask my sister,” she says. “All I can immediately remember is being snowed in for months in Japan, and being terribly sea-sick on a long ship-ride to Europe.” Katrina has been a part of Indian films since 2003. She has been working in movies for over 22 years now and is most notably known for her work in films like Namastey London, Jab Tak Hai Jaan, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani, Tiger series among many others.

It is tied with Hurricane Harvey as being the costliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin . Katrina was the twelfth tropical cyclone, the fifth hurricane, the third major hurricane , and the second Category 5 hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season . It was also the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States , as measured by barometric pressure . Katrina formed on August 23, 2005, with the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of a tropical depression . After briefly strengthening to a tropical storm over south Florida, Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 26 and rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane before weakening to a Category 3 at its landfall on August 29 near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana . Eighty percent of New Orleans, as well as large areas in neighboring parishes , were flooded. It is estimated that about 100,000 to 150,000 people remained in the City of New Orleans, despite mandatory evacuation orders. The flooding prompted a massive national and international response effort, including federal, local, and private rescue operations. The largest loss of life was due to flooding caused by engineering flaws in the federally built hurricane protection system, particularly the levees around New Orleans. Investigators concluded that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , tasked by Congress in the Flood Control Act of 1965 to design and build the region's hurricane protection, was responsible for the breached floodwalls . Later, a federal appeals court ruled that the Army Corps, despite being responsible, could not be held financially liable due to the Flood Control Act of 1928 . The emergency response from federal, state, and local governments was widely criticized, leading to the resignation of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown and New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) superintendent Eddie Compass . Many other government officials faced criticism for their responses, especially New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin , Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco , and President George W. Bush . However, several agencies, such as the United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Hurricane Center (NHC), and National Weather Service (NWS), were commended for their actions, with the NHC being particularly praised for its accurate forecasts well in advance. [ 1 ] The destruction and loss of life caused by the storm prompted the name Katrina to be retired by the World Meteorological Organization in April 2006. On January 4, 2023, the NHC updated the Katrina fatality data based on a 2014 report, which reduced the total number from an estimated 1,833 to 1,392.

One of India's highest-paid actresses, she has received various accolades , including four Screen Awards and four Zee Cine Awards , alongside three Filmfare Awards nominations. Although critical reception to her acting has varied, she is noted for her roles in action films and her dancing ability. Born in British Hong Kong , Kaif lived in several countries before moving to London , where she spent three years. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career in fashion modelling. At a fashion show in London, Indian filmmaker Kaizad Gustad cast her in Boom (2003), which was a critical and commercial failure. While Kaif established a successful modelling career in India, she initially faced difficulty securing film roles due to her limited command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film Malliswari (2004), Kaif achieved commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). Further success followed with a series of box-office hits, though she was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles, and preference for male-dominated films. Kaif's performances in the thriller New York (2009) and the romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011) were better received, earning her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress . Her career progressed with roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010), and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011). She found major commercial success in the action thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), and Bang Bang! (2014), which ranked among the highest-grossing Indian films of that decade. Following a brief setback, the action films Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), Sooryavanshi (2021), and Tiger 3 (2023), along with the drama Bharat (2019), emerged as box-office hits. Kaif's portrayal of an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama Zero (2018) earned her the Zee Cine Award for Best Supporting Actress and her performance in the mystery thriller Merry Christmas (2024) was well-received. In the media, Kaif frequently appears in listings of India’s most popular and attractive celebrities. A regular brand endorser, she launched her cosmetic line Kay Beauty in 2019. She participates in stage shows and is involved with her mother’s charity, Relief Projects India, which helps underprivileged children. Kaif is married to actor Vicky Kaushal , with whom she has a son.

[ 5 ] Kaif's paternal parentage has been questioned by some members of the film industry. [ 1 ] In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror , Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: \"We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience ... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too ... religious? ...

Hurricane Katrina was a tropical cyclone that struck the southeastern United States in late August 2005. The hurricane and its aftermath claimed nearly 1,400 lives, and it ranked as the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history . Who was Hurricane Katrina named after? There is no particular person for whom Hurricane Katrina was named. Rather, the hurricane was named in accordance with the World Meteorological Organization’s lists of hurricane names , which rotate every six years. Following the historical damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina, the name Katrina was retired from the lists of names. What were Hurricane Katrina’s wind speeds? When Hurricane Katrina first made landfall in Florida between Miami and Fort Lauderdale , it was a category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour. By the time the storm strengthened to a category 3 hurricane, winds exceeded 115 miles per hour. At its height as a category 5 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico , Katrina’s wind speeds exceeded 170 miles per hour. Why did Hurricane Katrina lead to widespread flooding? After it made landfall in Louisiana on August 29, Hurricane Katrina produced widespread flooding in southeastern Louisiana because the levee system that held back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Borgne was completely overwhelmed by 10 inches of rain and Katrina’s storm surge . An estimated 80 percent of New Orleans was underwater by August 30.

The st...", "full_content": "Early in the morning on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast of the United States. When the storm made landfall, it had a Category 3 rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale–it brought sustained winds of 100–140 miles per hour–and stretched some 400 miles across. While the storm itself did a great deal of damage, its aftermath was catastrophic. Levee breaches led to massive flooding, and many people charged that the federal government was slow to meet the needs of the people affected by the storm. Hundreds of thousands of people in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were displaced from their homes, and experts estimate that Katrina caused more than $100 billion in damage. U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer Laurence Nettles describes helicopter rescues and details how the Coast Guard prepared for Hurricane Katrina. The tropical depression that became Hurricane Katrina formed over the Bahamas on August 23, 2005, and meteorologists were soon able to warn people in the Gulf Coast states that a major storm was on its way. By August 28, evacuations were underway across the region. That day, the National Weather Service predicted that after the storm hit, “most of the [Gulf Coast] area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer.” During the past century, hurricanes have flooded New Orleans six times: in 1915, 1940, 1947, 1965, 1969 and 2005. New Orleanswas at particular risk. Though about half the city actually lies above sea level, its average elevation is about six feet below sea level–and it is completely surrounded by water. Over the course of the 20th century, the Army Corps of Engineers had built a system of levees and seawalls to keep the city from flooding. The levees along theMississippiRiver were strong and sturdy, but the ones built to hold back Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Borgne and the waterlogged swamps and marshes to the city’s east and west were much less reliable. New Orleans on average is 6 feet below sea level and Hurricane Katrina turned fatal after levees failed catastrophically. Here, on August 30, 2005, water can be seen spilling over along the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal. New Orleans on average is 6 feet below sea level and Hurricane Katrina turned fatal after levees failed catastrophically. Here, on August 30, 2005, water can be seen spilling over along the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal. Before the storm, officials worried that surge could overtop some levees and cause short-term flooding, but no one predicted levees might collapse below their designed height. Neighborhoods that sat below sea level, many of which housed the city’s poorest and most vulnerable people, were at great risk of flooding. The day before Katrina hit, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin issued the city’s first-ever mandatory evacuation order. He also declared that the Superdome, a stadium located on relatively high ground near downtown, would serve as a “shelter of last resort” for people who could not leave the city. (For example, some 112,000 of New Orleans’ nearly 500,000 people did not have access to a car.) By nightfall, almost 80 percent of the city’s population had evacuated. Some 10,000 had sought shelter in the Superdome, while tens of thousands of others chose to wait out the storm at home. By the time Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans early in the morning on Monday, August 29, it had already been raining heavily for hours. When the storm surge (as high as 9 meters in some places) arrived, it overwhelmed many of the city’s unstable levees and drainage canals. Water seeped through the soil underneath some levees and swept others away altogether. By 9 a.m., low-lying places like St. Bernard Parish and the Ninth Ward were under so much water that people had to scramble to attics and rooftops for safety. Eventually, nearly 80 percent of the city was under some quantity of water. Quintella Williams feeds her 9-day-old baby girl, Akea, outside the Superdome as she awaits evacuation from the flooded city. Quintella Williams feeds her 9-day-old baby girl, Akea, outside the Superdome as she awaits evacuation from the flooded city. Many people acted heroically in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Coast Guard rescued some 34,000 people in New Orleans alone, and many ordinary citizens commandeered boats, offered food and shelter, and did whatever else they could to help their neighbors. Yet the government–particularly the federal government–seemed unprepared for the disaster. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) took days to establish operations in New Orleans, and even then did not seem to have a sound plan of action. Officials, even including PresidentGeorge W. Bush, seemed unaware of just how bad things were in New Orleans and elsewhere: how many people were stranded or missing; how many homes and businesses had been damaged; how much food, water and aid was needed.

It is the costliest hurricane to ever hit the United States, surpassing the record previously held by Hurricane Andrew from 1992. In addition, Katrina is one of the five deadliest hurricanes to ever strike the United States. In all, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 1,833 fatalities and approximately $108 billion in damage (un-adjusted 2005 dollars). On August 23rd, a tropical depression formed over the southeastern Bahamas, becoming Tropical Storm Katrina on August 24th as it moved into the central Bahamas. The storm continued to track west while gradually intensifying and made its initial landfall along the southeast Florida coast on August 25th as a Category 1 hurricane (80mph) on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After moving west across south Florida and into the very warm waters of the Gulf, Katrina intensified rapidly and attained Category 5 status (with peak sustained winds of 175mph) for a period of time as it moved northwest on August 28th. Katrina weakened to a Category 3 before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast, first in southeast Louisiana (sustained winds: 125mph) and then made landfall once more along the Mississippi Gulf Coast (sustained winds: 120mph). Katrina finally weakened below hurricane intensity late on August 29th over east central Mississippi. The damage and loss of life inflicted by this massive hurricane in Louisiana and Mississippi was staggering with significant effects extending into Alabama and the western Florida panhandle. This was a storm that captivated the public and media with most coverage occurring in the New Orleans area. Considering the scope of its impacts, Katrina was one of the most devastating natural disasters in United States history. As Katrina set new minimum central pressure records whileapproaching the northern Gulf Coast on Sunday, August 28th, the storm made its final turn to the north as it moved toward southeastern Louisiana. Katrina was a large storm with a verydistinct eye. Early on the 28th, Katrina reached a minimum central pressure of 902mb (at the peak) - ranking 7th lowest on record for all Atlantic Basin hurricanes - and rapidly intensified to a Category 5 (175mph). Katrina then weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it moved across the north central Gulf and weakened further to a strong Category 3 hurricane shortly before making landfall in southeast Louisiana. The central pressure atlandfallwas 920mb - ranking 3rd lowest on record for a US landfalling hurricane, behind Hurricane Camille in 1969 (900mb) and the Labor Day Hurricane that struck the Florida Keys in 1935 (892mb).

STORM SURGEKnown for its storm surge, Katrina’s highest surge was found in a zone from just east of the eye near Bay St. Louis, MS east to the northern reaches of Mobile Bay. The Mobile State Docks measured the highest storm surge of 11.45 feet, while the lowest was 4.1 feet in the Santa Rosa Sound in northwest Florida. Storm surge was as high as 12-14 feet in Bayou La Batre, AL and likely close to 20 feet along the Mississippi-Alabama border. Many homes were engulfed by Katrina’s surge in Bayou La Batre, AL.Major beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to east of Destin. The west end of Dauphin Island was completely under waterwith most of the homes on the west end washed away. The surge in Mobile Bay led to inundation of downtown Mobile causing the imposition of a dusk-to-dawn curfew.The Wallace Tunnel wasclosed due to high water from the surge.Most of the businesses on the Causeway over Mobile Bay were damaged or destroyed bythe high water. An oil rigbroke free and floated up Mobile Bay andbecame lodged underneath theCochran-Africatown Bridge. The Mobile State Docks surge value of 11.45 feet was very close to being the highest value ever recorded. The previous record of 11.60 feet was set on July 5, 1916. [The exact location and degree of accuracy of the 1916 record surge value is unknown.] No lives were lost due to the storm surge across Mobile and Baldwin Counties in southern Alabama. Long lead warning times were given by the NWS Offices in Mobile, AL and New Orleans, LA as to how high the surge would be.

Photograph by Vincent Laforet, The New York Times/Redux ENVIRONMENT Here’s what made Hurricane Katrina one of the worst storms in U.S. history. With winds reaching as high as 120 miles per hour, the Category 3 storm devastated New Orleans and coastal Louisiana—and its effects are still felt today. By Sarah Gibbens August 22, 2025 Hurricane Katrina was a Category 3 storm that made landfall off the Louisiana coast on August 29, 2005, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 120 miles per hour. Because of the ensuing destruction and loss of life, Hurricane Katrina is often considered one of the worst storms in U.S. history. An estimated 1,200 people died as a direct result of the storm, which also cost an estimated $108 billion in property damage , making it the costliest hurricane on record. The devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina exposed a series of deep-rooted problems, including controversies over the federal government’s response, difficulties in search-and-rescue efforts, and lack of preparedness for the storm, particularly regarding the city’s aging levees. Fifty of those levees failed during the storm, significantly flooding the low-lying city and causing much of the damage. The city’s Lower Ninth Ward was impacted the most from levee failure, resulting in the suffering of a disproportionate number of low-income and African American families. Many who lost their homes faced years of hardship. The area is still working to recover today. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama said of Katrina , “What started out as a natural disaster became a man-made disaster—a failure of government to look out for its own citizens.” ( What are hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons ?) The city of New Orleans and other coastal communities in Katrina’s path remain significantly altered , physically and culturally. The damage was so extensive that some pundits had argued, controversially, that New Orleans should be permanently abandoned , even as the city vowed to rebuild. In the year after Katrina, the population of New Orleans fell by more than half, according to Data Center Research . As of this writing, the city has returned to nearly 80 percent of its pre-Katrina population numbers. The timeline of Hurricane Katrina Katrina first formed as a tropical depression in Caribbean waters near the Bahamas on August 23, 2005. Two days later, it became a Category 1 storm as it passed into south Florida and over southeastern Miami. The tempest blew through Miami, where winds reached 80 miles per hour, uprooting trees and killing two people. Without warm ocean water to sustain its wind speed and strength, Katrina weakened to a tropical storm. However, once it crossed back into the Gulf of Mexico, the storm quickly regained its strength and hurricane status. ( Read a detailed timeline of how the storm developed ) On August 27, the storm grew to a Category 3 hurricane. At its largest, Katrina was so wide its diameter stretched across the Gulf of Mexico . Before the hurricane struck land, a mandatory evacuation was issued for the city of New Orleans, which had a population of more than 480,000 at the time. Tens of thousands of residents fled. But when the storm hit, about 100,000 were trapped in the city , particularly the poorest residents, the elderly, and people who lacked access to transportation. Many residents sheltered in their homes. About 25,000 made their way to the Superdome , the city’s large sports arena, where conditions soon deteriorated into hardship and chaos. Katrina passed over the Gulf Coast early on the morning of August 29. Officials initially believed New Orleans was spared as most of the storm battered areas toward the Mississippi coast, near Biloxi, Mississippi, where winds were the strongest and damage more extensive. Later that morning, a levee broke in New Orleans and a surge of floodwater began pouring into the low-lying city. The waters soon overwhelmed additional levees. ( Do female hurricanes really kill more people than male ones? ) The following day, Katrina weakened to a tropical storm, but severe flooding inhibited relief efforts in much of New Orleans. An estimated 80 percent of the city was under water. By September 2, four days later, the city and surrounding areas were in full-on crisis mode, with stranded people and companion animals and collapsing infrastructure and services. Congress issued $10 billion for disaster relief aid even as much of the world began criticizing the U.S. government’s response . Controversy followed aid groups as they moved into the area.

ByJesse Ferrell, AccuWeather meteorologist and senior weather editor Published Aug 20, 2025 7:22 PM IST|Updated Aug 29, 2025 6:02 PM IST It was 20 years ago that catastrophic Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans after making landfall in August 2005. Here’s a look back at how the storm forever changed the landscape of the city. On Aug. 19, 2005, a tropical wave formed in the Caribbean, one of many that hurricane season. But this one would evolve into one of the most devastating storms in U.S. history. Ten days later, after crossing southern Florida with 90-mph winds and a foot of rain, Hurricane Katrina became a Category 5 monster in the Gulf. It slammed into the coast as a Category 3 storm. It would prove to be the most expensive hurricane in history, decimating the Mississippi coast with a storm surge higher than a three-story home that put most of New Orleans underwater for days. Hurricane Katrina at maximum intensity at sunset on August 28, 2005. (NOAA/JHUAPL) Now, 20 years later, AccuWeather looks back at the staggering numbers associated with the huge storm. Hurricane Katrina killed 1,392 people, including 520 direct deaths, 341 of which were in Louisiana, according toan update from the National Hurricane Center in 2023. That number also includes 565 indirect deaths (mostly heart attacks) and 307 deaths of indeterminate cause. Katrina was the deadliest hurricane for the United States since 1929 and remained that until 2017, when Hurricane Maria killed nearly 3,000 people in Puerto Rico. AccuWeather estimates the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Katrina was $320 billion, adjusted for inflation today. When Katrina was at its peak as a Category 5 hurricane over the Gulf, its sustained winds were 175 mph. Its central pressure was 26.64 inches of mercury (902 mb), one of the top 5 lowest pressures ever measured in the Atlantic at the time. The highest wind gust measured on land from Hurricane Katrina was 136 mph at Poplarville, Mississippi, but in 2005, there were a fraction of the weather stations that are operational now, and it's likely higher gusts would be measured with a similar storm today. After the levees around New Orleans suffered more than 50 failures, it's estimated that 80 percent of the city was underwater, as well as large areas of neighboring parishes. According to a report published in 2015,the main cause of the levees failingwas the sheet piles in the flood walls that were only driven to 17 feet deep, instead of 31 to 46 feet deep, due to a misinterpretation of a 1985 study. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health reveal thatbetween 150,000 and 200,000 New Orleans residents stayed in the citydespite evacuation orders. Reasons for this ranged from not wanting to leave pets —44 percent of those surveyed by ASPCA— not having transportation or not wanting to leave property and possessions behind. In this Sept. 1, 2005, file photo, residents wait on a rooftop to be rescued from the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. It is the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. But to many, especially to those in greater New Orleans, this catastrophe was anything but an act of God. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, Pool, File) The University of Washington puts the cost of theimproved levee systemaround New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina at $15 billion. Over 150 miles of levees were upgraded by 2015. Katrina's storm surge was worst on the coast of Mississippi, where a 27-foot storm surge was found to have penetrated 6 miles inland on land and 12 miles inland along rivers. As a result,90 percentof structures within half a mile of the coast near landfall were completely destroyed. The Superdome in New Orleanssheltered 26,000 people, but during the storm, it became surrounded by water and lost part of its roof. Days after the storm hit, with squalid conditions and no power or water to the Superdome, most evacuees were moved to the Astrodome in Houston. The Super Dome is seen in flooded downtown New Orleans, Louisiana on August 30, 2005, a day after Hurricane Katrina devastated the region. Hurricane Katrina slammed Louisiana as a category 3 storm, forcing levies to brake and flooding much of New Orleans.

Louisiana's heaviest rainfall was 14.82 inches at Big Branch. An estimated 90,000 square miles of the United States were under federal disaster declarations from Hurricane Katrina at one point or another, around the size of the entire United Kingdom. At the peak of power outages, more than 3 million customers (homes and businesses) in the United States were without power because of Hurricane Katrina.

For residents of New Orleans and the surrounding areas, those memories are marked by first warnings, rising panic and a surreal mix of preparation and disbelief as the city experienced one of the deadliest storms in American history. For the meteorologists tracking the storm, police officers and nurses preparing for the worst and community members trying to make sense of it all, those days became an intensely personal ordeal, shaped by both duty and survival. This oral history traces the last hours leading up to Katrina’s final landfall, from the Gulf Coast’s first alerts to the catastrophic levee failures. Based on hours of interviews with survivors and officials, some of whom have never shared their stories publicly, this timeline captures the fear, courage and chaos that unfolded. Friday, August 26, 2005: Three Days Before Final Landfall Robert Ricks , Lead Forecaster, National Weather Service New Orleans : We were tracking it several days out. We knew it was going to definitely be a threat for Florida at the time. Bernie Cullen , Chairman, Waveland’s Ground Zero Hurricane Museum : I think nobody expected it. I mean, that was the sad thing. You know, we kept hearing it was going to Florida. It was going to Florida. Then all of a sudden, you know, she had a mind of her own. Katrina did. Robert Ricks : Models started showing it, becoming an increasingly more likely threat for the middle Gulf Coast region, New Orleans. But Mississippi-Gulf Coast region. BreArd Snellings , New Orleans area native : For kids who grew up down here, hurricanes are, it sounds crazy to say, but, like, a good thing, a cool thing. It's a couple of days off of school. Bernie Cullen : My husband and I live here in Waveland, Mississippi, but we both worked in New Orleans as nurses. We were preparing like we always do, you know, what are we going to do? When are we going to call it? When are we going to have staff come in? Tim Bayard , Retired Captain, New Orleans Police Department : I was working the Saints-Baltimore Ravens preseason football game. At the end of the game, I walked into the roll call room and the TV was on, and there was Katrina. BreArd Snellings : I was actually, coming out of, going to a Saints preseason game for my birthday when we started to hear about it. The storm's coming a couple of days from now. And so, having to make sure my friends would get home to their parents, they were looking into ideas, what they might do, would they evacuate, how would they handle the storm? Tim Bayard : I turned around and told the chief, I said, if that's coming at us, we better have a lot of high water vehicles, food and water and a lot of body bags. Saturday, August 27, 2005: Two Days Before Final Landfall Robert Ricks : Saturday comes and we see it emerging off the Florida coast, getting into the Gulf. Bernie Cullen : She basically went back in the Gulf, intensified, became a monster storm and filled the entire Gulf. Joshua Lee Nidenberg , Louisiana lifestyle photographer : I had an appointment to deliver a life insurance policy to a woman. And I was calling to confirm the appointment, and she answered the phone and she said, ‘I'm almost to Mobile and I'm on my way to Pensacola.’ I said, ‘Really, why are you doing that?’ She says, ‘are you not aware there's a storm in the Gulf?’ And I remember muttering under my breath, ‘what a sissy.’ Little Freddie King , New Orleans Blues Master : I was living back on Lafitte Street near Bayou Saint John, back there in Mid-city. And so, some friends of mine at the Monteleone Hotel, they called me up and say, 'There's a bad storm coming through here. So I want you to come out here and stay with us in the hotel.' I told them, I said, no, no, I said, I'm all right. I said. Bernie Cullen : Then you've got people having to make the hard decision of, do I get on the road and get stuck in my car? When should you leave? What should you take? When do you come back? \"Wacko\" Wade Wright , New Orleans-based drummer and manager : When I heard the storm was in the Gulf and it looked pretty, it looked pretty big. But to me, it was just a normal hurricane coming. So I said to myself, I'll just ride it out because you never think of water. You never think of flooding. Robert Ricks : My concern sort of growing when the satellite imagery showed what was originally a covered eye, eyewall that was covered by cloud cover. The cloud cover parted, and we saw this massive eye of one I've never seen in my professional career before. Leon “Kid Chocolate” Brown , New Orleans-based musical artist : People around me are getting more serious about it. My mother's calling me. Asking me what are my plans? Do I plan to evacuate? Robert Ricks : We all knew that we were dealing with what was going to eventually be a catastrophic storm.

I mean, it was, we pulled into New Orleans and you could see the smoke, you could smell everything burning. I remember it was hot. I can remember that,” said Matt Clark, a retired Chief Gunner’s Mate in the United States Navy. He was on the USS Tortuga in 2005. His ship and fellow crew members were deployed to Louisiana following Katrina’s landfall.

By Aug. 24, it strengthened and became Tropical Storm Katrina. Katrina continued to intensify and made its first landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near Miami, Florida. The storm moved across South Florida and out into the Gulf. From there, Katrina rapidly intensified over warm Gulf waters and briefly became a powerful Category 5 hurricane, setting new records. On Aug. 29, Katrina, a Category 3 hurricane at this point, made a second landfall in Buras, Louisiana, followed by a third near the mouth of the Pearl River. The storm brought catastrophic effects with more than 1,800 lives lost and billions of dollars in damage.

We're in a much better position or place now in the city than we were then,” said Collin Arnold, the director of the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management for the City of New Orleans. New Orleans looks a lot different today than it did in late August and early September 2005. “There was nothing. There was no life, there was no movement. There were no people, there was nothing happening. It was a major city, and there was nothing there. It was just destruction,” Clark said. “We were kind of just trying to prepare for a little bit of everything.\" READ MORE |\"Just 1% of non-Floridian homeowners hit by Hurricane Helene had flood insurance.\" They were tasked with helping the Coast Guard on the first morning they were there.

And as we ran into people, we just offered help. You know, ‘do you need food? Do you need water? Do you want to get out of here? Do you want air conditioning?’ And most people didn't want to leave. Some did. And then we took them back.\" “It was really hard to find fuel. I mean, we had barely enough gas on board the ship to even operate our own craft. There was no power anywhere. The roads were all blocked. I mean, it was a really difficult area to get any kind of assistance into,” said Clark.

As they crossed into Mississippi, they started seeing some of the devastation. “A lot of trees down,\" Reno said. \"You could see where there were boats that were in places that boats shouldn't be.” Those sights of destruction continued as they drove into Gulfport, and the smells seeped in. “So Gulfport is a port city.

A critical one: A new power station that came online in July. This will help power the city’s pumps, which have always been an issue. “It’s a massive pumping system, 30 pump stations. It has the equivalent capacity of pumping the Ohio River in the opposite direction,” said Arnold. “It’s going to be a game changer for us as far as being able to really power that drainage system through anything.” READ MORE |\"Western Carolinas reflects on Helene's impact as it rebui", "url": "https://abcnews4.com/news/local/two-decades-later-new-orleans-reflects-on-katrinas-impact-and-future-preparedness-hurricanes-ready-4-the-storm-wciv-abc-news-4-8-21-2025", "domain": "abcnews4.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 6385}, {"source_number": 11, "title": "Indiatimes From adventurous Laila to real-life mom: Here’s how Katrina Kaif’s characters mirror her journey into motherhood", "snippet": "8 hours ago - Katrina Kaif’s career has been defined by iconic roles, but her newest role as a mother marks a significant personal milestone.

On Aug. 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi as a Category 3 hurricane. It became one of the most devastating disasters in U.S. history, claiming nearly 1,400 lives, displacing approximately 770,000 people and causing billions of dollars in economic losses and infrastructure damage. Federal disaster declarations ultimately covered about 90,000 square miles across the region. New Orleans and neighboring parishes were among the hardest hit by catastrophic flooding. An estimated 100,000 to 150,000 people did not, or were unable to, evacuate from the city, prompting a massive national and international response. To date, FEMA has provided communities affected by Hurricane Katrina with more than $6.6 billion in Individual Assistance for housing and other needs, and more than $17.1 billion in Public Assistance to help rebuild critical infrastructure like schools, hospitals, roads and bridges. The federal government’s response to Katrina led to significant scrutiny and a comprehensive reexamination of how the nation prepares for and manages large-scale disasters. In 2006, Congress enacted the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act , which established FEMA as a distinct agency within the Department of Homeland Security, defined FEMA’s primary mission and authorized the pre-positioning of federal assets – including essential commodities, equipment and search and rescue personnel – for deployment at a state’s request ahead of a disaster. Even with this progress, FEMA continues to reform and improve how the agency works to supports states before, during and after disasters.

One of India's highest-paid actresses, she has received various accolades , including four Screen Awards and four Zee Cine Awards , alongside three Filmfare Awards nominations. Although critical reception to her acting has varied, she is noted for her roles in action films and her dancing ability. Born in British Hong Kong , Kaif lived in several countries before moving to London , where she spent three years. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career in fashion modelling. At a fashion show in London, Indian filmmaker Kaizad Gustad cast her in Boom (2003), which was a critical and commercial failure. While Kaif established a successful modelling career in India, she initially faced difficulty securing film roles due to her limited command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film Malliswari (2004), Kaif achieved commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). Further success followed with a series of box-office hits, though she was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles, and preference for male-dominated films. Kaif's performances in the thriller New York (2009) and the romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011) were better received, earning her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress . Her career progressed with roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010), and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011). She found major commercial success in the action thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), and Bang Bang! (2014), which ranked among the highest-grossing Indian films of that decade. Following a brief setback, the action films Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), Sooryavanshi (2021), and Tiger 3 (2023), along with the drama Bharat (2019), emerged as box-office hits. Kaif's portrayal of an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama Zero (2018) earned her the Zee Cine Award for Best Supporting Actress and her performance in the mystery thriller Merry Christmas (2024) was well-received. In the media, Kaif frequently appears in listings of India’s most popular and attractive celebrities. A regular brand endorser, she launched her cosmetic line Kay Beauty in 2019. She participates in stage shows and is involved with her mother’s charity, Relief Projects India, which helps underprivileged children.

Her mother is now re-settled in Chennai (formerly known as Madras), the Capital of the state of Tamil Nadu in India. She spent subsequent years in Hawaii, and then in London, Britain, She started modeling accidentally when she was in Hawaii at the tender age of 14, when she was approached for a jewelry campaign. Thereafter she continued modeling in London. Continuing to model was the reason she got her break in a Bollywood movie Boom (2003) offered by none other than film-maker Kaizad Gustad. She was flooded with modeling assignments the minute she set her foot on Indian soil, especially with her innocent expressive face, hour-glass figure, and drop-dead gorgeous looks. Professionally she started off as a model with photographer Atul Kasbekar, and upon being accepted, she received offers from LG, Cola, Fevicol, Lakme, & Veet. It was the Lakme commercial that got her noticed. She retained Matrix as her Manager to accept work on her behalf and at the price she deserved. Moving to different culture and country was not much of a culture shock for her, as she states that no matter where you come from, the bottom line is that everyone wants to be loved, respected, and cared for. Despite of her positive attitude, she had been stereotyped as \"Indian\" by extreme right-wingers in Britain who made it clear that she did not quite fit-in with their \"Blonde\" Caucasian culture; while on the other hand in India itself she had been ranked as an 'outsider' very much like Sonia Gandhi. Unlike other artistes from foreign lands, Katrina did not experience any difficulties in getting a visa nor of getting it extended in India. Although linguistically challenged, Katrina puts on a bold face and states that other Bollywood artistes like Sridevi, who did not know Hindi, did get offers from Bollywood film-makers, and she is no different. She has taken Hindi and dancing lessons to fit in with the Bollywood culture. She likes to display a picture of her learning Kathak dancing where she used to dance 7 hours a day non-stop. Adorned with soft gorgeous looks, she is not easily intimidated, but admits that she is very emotional, sensitive, and concerned about her privacy, Almost an incurable romantic, she prefers to wear comfortable non-revealing clothes when at home, hates to do her hair, and above all dislikes make-up. Admitting to being lonely in the beginning, but now has several friends who she can hang out with. Although her first movie Boom (2003) was panned by the critics and shunned by the audiences, two other Telugu movies Malliswari (2004) and Allari Pidugu (2005) did get her noticed. She grossed 70 Lakh Rupees for Malliswari (2004) - making her top the list of the highest paid actresses during a South Indian movie debut. Not done with South Indian movies, she has been signed in a Tamil movie 'Bheema' opposite National Award Winner Vikram. She has received decent reviews for her part in \"Maine Pyar Kyon Kiya\", as well as a brief appearance in 'Sarkar'. Katrina had made Mumbai her base, didn't mind singing and dancing around trees and as a result is now one of the biggest mega-stars, perhaps one of the highest paid female-lead actresses in Bollywood, and a crowd-puller whenever she makes an appearance for a live song and dance number.

His decision comes before this summer's five-Test tour of England, which starts on 20 June, and follows captain Rohit Sharma's retirement on Wednesday . Kohli, 36, has played 123 Tests for India and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85. \"It's been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket,\" Kohli posted on social media. \"Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It's tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I'll carry for life.\" Kohli retired from T20 internationals in 2024, after India's World Cup victory, but is expected to continue playing one-day internationals. After making his Test debut against West Indies in 2011, Kohli went on to captain India in 68 of his Tests, with his 40 wins in charge making him the country's most successful leader in the format. Virat Kohli Retires from Test Cricket: End of an Era? \"There's something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no-one sees but that stay with you forever,\" he added. \"As I step away from this format, it's not easy - but it feels right. I've given it everything I had, and it's given me back so much more than I could've hoped for. \"I'm walking away with a heart full of gratitude - for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way. I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile.\" India cricket's governing body, the BCCI, praised Kohli for \"redefining the standards of excellence, leadership and commitment in Indian cricket\". BCCI president Roger Binny added: \"Virat Kohli's name will be remembered alongside the finest ever to have graced Test cricket. \"What set him apart was not just his hunger for runs, but his commitment to excellence in the toughest format of the game. His leadership marked a shift in how India competed overseas—with aggression, belief and a refusal to settle for second best. \"He inspired a generation to take pride in the whites, and his impact on Indian cricket will be felt for decades to come.\" Kohli has long been regarded as one of the four batting greats of his era, alongside England's Joe Root, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson, and has scored 30 Test centuries. Only Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar have scored more Test runs for India than Kohli, while he has the most centuries for an India captain with 20. But his most recent Test ton, 100 not out in the first Test against Australia in November, was his first in 15 innings across 16 months. During that series, he scored 190 runs in nine innings averaging just 23.75. Only three tons have come in 39 Tests since January 2020. He averages 30.72 in that time. 'Farewell to cricket's greatest showman' Analysis by chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt And so cricket's greatest showman leaves its grandest stage. Not with a final century, wave of the bat or guard of honour, but with a post to his 271m Instagram followers. The end of an aura. It is hard to overstate Kohli's fame, stardom or influence. He is the biggest presence in the most powerful cricketing nation on the planet. Maybe his name does not travel globally like a Ronaldo or Messi, yet even those two titans will have no idea what it feels like to be Virat Kohli in India. As a batter, Kohli continued the talismanic lineage of Gavaskar, Azharuddin and Tendulkar. His cover drive is a work of art. In 2018, a Kohli net session in Adelaide went viral, the ball leaving the bat with sound of a pistol being fired. He is the first of the Fab Four to leave Test cricket and while his numbers do not stack up to Smith, Root and Williamson, Kohli is the most pleasing to watch. As a leader, Kohli dragged the India Test side into the 21st Century. Having more Test wins than any other India captain is statistically significant, though that pales when compared to what Kohli did for his team and Test cricket itself. It is not an exaggeration to say Kohli was the most important factor in upkeeping the relevance of the longest format when it could otherwise have been completely swallowed by the T20 leagues. Kohli follows Rohit Sharma into retirement as the regeneration of the India Test team continues. The XI that lines up to face England at Headingley in late June will have an unfamiliar feel. There may be more one-day internationals to savour. In that format, Kohli really is the GOAT. Even with the histrionics, everything he did was must-see. Without Kohli, Test cricket will be a poorer spectacle.

The Indian great, who has already retired from T20Is and Tests, is in the twilight of his career facebook twitter WhatsApp reddit E-mail File photo of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma © Instagram Virat Kohli turned 37 on November 5, 2025. The Indian great, who has already retired from T20Is and Tests, is in the twilight of his career. In the recently held India vs Australia ODI series, Kohli was out for 0 twice before scoring a fine 74* in the third match. Several former cricketers have said that if Kohli is fit, he should be considered for the 2027 ODI World Cup. If Kohli does play in the marquee event, it will be his fifth World Cup - the first being the 2011 edition. Over the last two decades, Kohli's journey has been highly intriguing. Mohammad Kaif , who has played with Kohli in the IPL, shared an interesting perspective on how Kohli has changed over the years. A fan asked him whether Virat Kohli has changed over time, and Kaif's reply was quite detailed. \"Virat Kohli has become a bit calmer now. He is a father. There is a lot of difference between how he was before marriage and how he is after marriage. When I see him playing now - I had met him during an IPL game against Punjab Kings - he hit Kagiso Rabada for a boundary coming down the ground. Maybe he had scored a half-century and won the game. It was a seaming track. We had a nice chat. He was very calm. He told me that if I had not attacked Rabada early on, he would not have let me play. So I wanted to hit him off the first ball. Abhishek is doing the same thing. When it comes to his understanding of cricket, there is improvement with calmness,\" Kaif said on his YouTube channel. \"He still wants to improve his game after having played for so many years. And he still meets me the same way even now. If he called you a brother before, he will call you a brother now as well. When you meet him off the field, he will remember that he has played with you and will give you that respect. There is no change there.\" Meanwhile, former Australia captain Steve Waugh was effusive in his praise for India's batting behemoth Virat Kohli, calling the 'Chase Master' the \"greatest\" ODI player of all time and a \"once-in-a-generation\" cricketer. Virat, who turned 37 on Wednesday, burst onto the international cricket scene back in 2008 as a promising teenager from the streets of West Delhi. The batting wizard has reached a stratosphere in world cricket that few have achieved. With a World Cup and two ICC Champions Trophy titles in his trophy cabinet, Virat has redefined the standards of the ODI format. A bona fide legend in 50-over cricket, Virat - the second-highest run-getter in ODIs of all time - is the fastest to achieve milestones of 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000, 12,000, 13,000, and 14,000 runs in the format's history. In 305 ODIs, Virat has garnered 14,255 runs, and with a tally of 51 centuries, he holds the record for the most hundreds by a player in the format. \"Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are two all-time great players. Virat Kohli is probably the greatest one-day player of all time. You want to see them play everywhere. People on the Gold Coast would love to see them play, but they can't play every match,\" Waugh told reporters on Thursday.

[ 7 ] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket . [ 8 ] Kohli was unable to secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous factors. His father reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the U-15 team.

To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them. This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever before of his bowlers, especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batter for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in the Test rankings and a first-ever Test series win in Australia. India won 40 out of the 68 Tests in which Kohli led, making him the fourth-most successful captain in the world, behind Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh.

He smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs, and became the first batter to score 50 hundreds in ODIs - getting to the milestone in the 2023 World Cup semi-final, in the presence of Tendulkar, the man whose record he broke. Between 2016 and 2018, Kohli scored 3596 runs in 35 Tests at an average of 66.59, with 14 hundreds and eight fifties in 58 innings, with the 2018 tour of England being a high point. There was a dip thereafter - his average, over 55 at its peak after he scored his career-best of 254 against South Africa in Pune in 2019, slipped to around 46 by the end. He retired from Test cricket midway through IPL 2025. Fans turned up in whites at the Chinnaswamy for his next match to pay tribute to his red-ball career. The encounter was rained off but the sentiment remained: an appropriate display of affection for a player who had revitalised the home crowd's love for five-day cricket, yet ended his career with an average of 30.72 in his final 39 Tests. If a hint of what could have been remained about his Test career - ending with 9230 runs, the least prolific among the Fab Four - he seemed to be at peace with what was. He would soon go on to win the IPL trophy for the first time, on his 18th attempt, and declare the victory to still be \"five levels under Test cricket\". Kohli is a world champion multiple times over, having captained India to the 2008 Under-19 World Cup title and winning four more ICC trophies with the senior side: the 50-over World Cup in 2011, Champions Trophies in 2013 and 2025, and the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he scored 76 in the final. When he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batter as the batting greats of the previous era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing attitudes towards fitness in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. He was quite simply India's most powerful captain. At the centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him. - Virat Kohli is the only player in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to have played all seasons for one team: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) - He was picked by RCB soon after he captained India to victory in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup and has been retained by them ever since - Kohli is the IPL's highest run-scorer and the only one with more than 8000 runs - He holds the record for most IPL centuries (eight) as well as most runs in a season (973 in 2016).

He is also a former captain of the Indian cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 internationals (T20I) —making him one of India’s most successful captains.

(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft) Summary of this article Virat Kohli celebrates his 37th birthday on November 5 Virat Kohli is retired from Tests and T20Is He has scored most number of centuries in the ODI format Former India captain Virat Kohli, one of the greatest batters in the history of cricket, is celebrating his 37th birthday on November 5. Virat Kohli is a name that has become synonymous with passion, consistency, and the pursuit of excellence. Born in Delhi on November 5, 1988, Virat’s story is not just about runs and records; it’s about a relentless desire to be the best version of himself, both on and off the field. Growing up in a middle-class Punjabi household, Kohli’s early life was like that of any other boy who loved cricket. His father, Prem Kohli, was a lawyer, and his mother, Saroj, a homemaker, both of whom supported his dream from the very beginning. At the age of nine, Kohli joined the West Delhi Cricket Academy, where his coaches noticed his natural timing and unmatched focus. As a teenager, he represented Delhi in the Under-15 and Under-17 categories, quickly building a reputation as a technically sound and fiercely determined batter. From Delhi’s Dust to the World Stage His first major moment on the global stage came in 2008 when he captained India’s Under-19 team to victory in the ICC Under-19 World Cup held in Malaysia. That same year, he was picked for the Indian senior team for an ODI series in Sri Lanka.

Slowly but surely, Kohli cemented his place in India’s batting lineup, especially after the 2011 World Cup, where India lifted the trophy after 28 years and Kohli played a steady role in the middle order. As years went by, Kohli transformed from a promising youngster into India’s most dependable batter across formats. His hunger for runs was unmatched, whether it was chasing down targets in ODIs, anchoring innings in Tests, or controlling the tempo in T20s. How Leadership and Fitness Became Kohli’s Signature His aggressive body language and mental toughness made him stand out in a generation where composure often dominated expression. Kohli’s fitness revolution also changed Indian cricket; he led by example, making fitness a non-negotiable part of the team’s culture. Leadership came naturally to him. When he took over the captaincy from MS Dhoni, many wondered if his fiery personality could handle the weight of expectation. But Kohli not only handled it, he thrived under it. Under his captaincy, India became a dominant force, especially in Test cricket, achieving famous overseas wins in Australia and England and climbing to the top of the ICC Test rankings. His passion for the game often mirrored his performances, intense, calculated, and filled with emotion. A Record Book Called Virat Kohli Numbers alone can’t define a player, but in Kohli’s case, they help tell his story. In Test cricket, he has scored 9,230 runs with 30 centuries to his name. As a captain, he led India in 68 Tests, winning 40 of them, the most by any Indian Test captain. However, after a not-so-good Test series against Australia earlier this year, Kohli decided to retire from the longest format of the game. In ODIs, Kohli’s record is nothing short of extraordinary.

In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast. Grind through the ranks He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka, come August 2008. In the absence of the regular openers, Virat Kohli was given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series. He played some commendable knocks in his extended run as an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series. However, the established and formidable pair of Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out of the team The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level; that junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over the bowling attacks. He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too, lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory. The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh in the selectors' minds. Cementing a national spot The selectors had no choice but to give Kohli another go in the Indian side, and this time he strung together a number of impressive scores. After being given an extended run, he repaid their faith by notching up his maiden ODI hundred in an impressive run-chase against Sri Lanka in December 2009 - his first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases. In the World Cup final of 2011, the biggest stage of them all, Kohli, along with his Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated rescue effort with an 83-run stand after losing the openers early. This knock played a crucial role in setting the platform for MS Dhoni's fabled knock of 91*, which eventually won India the World Cup on that enchanting evening in Mumbai. In the hangover of the World Cup euphoria, Kohli continued to take giant strides in the limited-overs format. Three years after his ODI debut, he was finally handed the coveted Test cap in the Caribbean islands in July 2011, owing to the need to rest the senior players. After a series each against the Dukes ball and the SG ball, it was now time for his trial against the Kookaburra Down Under. In the first two Tests, he seemed to lack the technique to play in Australia, maintaining his low stance on the bouncy tracks. He also had a rather restricting trigger movement with his front-foot routinely coming across towards off-stump, thereby hindering the necessary movement to play back-foot shots such as the pull and the cut. A baptism by fire Down Under The selectors and the captain persisted with him going into the 3rd Test, and he delivered a break-through performance on a bouncy Perth wicket - an impressive 75 - where a visible change in technique was visible. He managed to stand tall, with a more open stance, and exhibited the back-foot shots in his repertoire during the course of the innings. The volatile Kohli managed to overshadow his impropriety in conduct with his performance in the final Test of the series. Notching up India's only century of a disastrous tour, Kohli was the shining light in amidst the chaos, as he stroked his way to a hundred in Adelaide exhibiting the will to improve and extraordinary focus under pressure in the searing heat and pressure of Australia. While he grappled and clawed his way into the Test side, he went on a record-breaking spree in ODIs: the Indian record for the fastest to multiples-of-thousand runs in ODIs, culminating in the world record for the fastest to 9000 runs in ODIs. He was also the highest run-scorer for India in ODIs for three consecutive calendar years - 2010, 2011 and 2012 and won the ICC ODI cricketer of the year award in 2012.

He was born into a Punjabi Hindu family – his mother Saroj was a housewife and father Prem Nath worked as a criminal lawyer. His love for cricket started early. At just three years old, he would grab a bat and ask his father to bowl to him. This early passion became the foundation of one of cricket’s most brilliant careers. Family backing : A turning point came in 1998 when neighbors suggested that professional training would serve his natural talent better than street cricket. His father received offers to move his son to powerful clubs that guaranteed selection. Yet Prem Nath turned these down, choosing the right path over easy shortcuts. This decision helped shape Kohli’s character and his approach to cricket. Educational journey : He first studied at Vishal Bharti Public School before moving to Savior Convent in ninth grade to focus on cricket. His family’s choice showed their dedication to nurturing his talent while balancing it with education. Training under Rajkumar Sharma The crucial meeting : Nine-year-old Virat and his father walked into the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) on May 30, 1998. They met coach Rajkumar Sharma – a moment that changed cricket history. Sharma saw something unique in the young boy, noting how his throws “thudded into the gloves of the wicketkeeper”. Disciplined development : Sharma’s guidance brought out Kohli’s dedication. “Virat never came late for the nets. He took great care of his gear. He wanted his pads and bats spotless. He always wanted to dominate,” his coach remembers. Sharma started the West Delhi Cricket Academy on May 30, 1998, which became famous for training talented batsmen like Kohli. Personal tragedy : Life changed on December 18, 2006, during a Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka when Kohli’s father died from a cerebral attack. The next day, Kohli returned to bat and scored 90 runs, helping Delhi avoid the follow-on. His mental strength amazed his coaches and teammates. Chetan Chauhan noted his determination and steadfast attitude during this tough time. U-19 World Cup triumph as captain Rising through ranks : Kohli’s path to international cricket started in youth games. He played his first junior cricket match in October 2002 at Luhnu Cricket Ground against Himachal Pradesh, scoring his first domestic half-century at Feroze Shah Kotla. The 2003-04 season saw him lead the U-15 team and score his first century (119) against Jammu and Kashmir. World Cup glory : Kohli’s youth career peaked when he led India to victory in the 2008 U-19 World Cup. The final happened on March 2, 2008, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. India beat South Africa by 12 runs (Duckworth-Lewis method). Kohli scored 20 runs while Tanmay Srivastava made 46 as India set 159 as the target. This victory gave India its second Under-19 World Cup title after Mohammad Kaif’s team won in 2000. Domestic cricket breakthrough with Delhi Ranji debut : His first-class career started on November 23, 2006, in the Ranji Trophy opener against Tamil Nadu. He scored just 10 runs. Starting at 18, he went on to score five centuries and five fifties for Delhi over six years. Statistical excellence : The numbers tell his story. He made 257 runs in six matches at 36.71 average during the 2006/07 Ranji season.

While he is considered one of the best batsmen of the present times... Placed amongst the highest level of sportsmen in India, Virat Kohli is considered an outstanding Indian international cricketer. While he is considered one of the best batsmen of the present times, his ability to bowl right-hand medium pace is equally appreciable. A powerful batsman, he is dependable and responsible for taking India to victory single-handedly in many matches. Early in his life, the game of cricket fascinated Virat. His parents recognised his potential and enrolled him at the West Delhi Cricket Academy. He was 9 years old then. His potential was honed and refined, and he became an extremely talented player. In the years that followed, Virat represented Delhi at different age-group levels and played domestic cricket. In 2008, he achieved his first big success as captain of India Under-19, which won the Under-19 World Cup that year. He was soon part of the Indian team, becoming an important middle-order player. He is considered an ‘ODI specialist’ and a superb test cricketer. He has been captain of the Indian cricket team in each of the three formats from 2013 to 2022. Virat Kohli was born in a Delhi-based Punjabi family. His father was a criminal lawyer, and his mother was a homemaker. Virat joined the West Delhi Cricket Academy at nine and trained under his first coach, Rajkumar Sharma, who saw the great potential in him. He believed that if trained well, Virat would attain great heights. Besides cricket training, Virat also excelled academically. His father provided both unconditional support and encouragement. Kohli lost his father to a stroke when he was 19 years old. It is a lesson to learn that Virat was on the field to play a Ranji match the next day and did tremendously well. The List A debut for Virat happened in February 2006. On that day, he played for Delhi against Services. He did not get a chance to bat, but Delhi won. Virat got a listing in over 273 List A matches. On 23rd November 2006, Virat made his Ranji Trophy debut. It was against Tamil Nadu. He showed his true grit when he played for Delhi against Karnataka in December. It was the day after his father died. His 90 runs proved critical for the match. This changed Virat’s life. To quote his mother, “Overnight, he became a much more mature person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It’s as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day.” During the Sri Lanka tour, Virat joined the Indian team on 18th August 2008. In the 4th game, he made his match-winning score of 54 runs. The series was won by India 3-2. At times he was not selected for the national team, but he still was showing his ability. He was selected for the 4-team Emerging Players Tournament (July & August 2009 – Australia). Virat, with 398 runs, was the tournament’s leading scorer, and he calls this tournament his career’s turning point. When Gautam Gambhir was injured, Kohli was called back for the Sri Lanka series and various tournaments, such as Champions Trophy (2009) and Australia. In Sri Lanka’s 4th ODI, Virat made his first century. The Gambhir-Kohli partnership of 224-was instrumental in Gambhir giving his Man of the Match award to Virat. In 2010, Virat made 995 runs (47.38 average) and became the highest run-scoring batsman. This got him a position on the Indian team. His ODI performance got Virat the name ‘Chase Master Kohli’. He has made 43 ODI centuries, and the current world record is 49. Virat’s ODI debut was on 18th August 2008 against Sri Lanka. When Australia toured India in 2020, he beat his record of Tendulkar by scoring the fastest 12,000 runs in ODI. Virat is in 4th position for the highest number of double centuries in test cricket. He got the highest ever test rating for an Indian batsman – 937 against England on 22nd August 2018. He has, in 82 matches, made 22 half-centuries and 26 centuries. Virat made his international T20 debut during the India tour of Zimbabwe on 12th June 2010. Virat has captained the national team in all three formats and has an average of 50 in T20I. He scored 94 on 6th December 2019, against West Indies, his highest T20I score. Virat has been part of Royal Challengers Bangalore since 2008, the inception of IPL. Few have remained in the same team all along. In 2013, he became captain of the team and still is. In the 2016 season, Virat made 973 runs, comprising seven half-centuries and 4 centuries.

With more than 20,000 international runs under his belt and 82 centuries across all three formats, Kohli is a master of his craft. The legendary batter has been serving the national team for nearly two decades and has played several memorable knocks for the Men in Blue. Kohli has also won every major international trophy except for the World Test Championship and he also finally got his hands on the elusive Indian Premier League title with Royal Challengers Bengaluru in 2025 as they beat Punjab Kings in the IPL final this year. Add The Sporting News as a preferred news source The right-hand batter has already retired from the T20 and the Test formats and is now only active in ODI cricket. He was recently in action for India against Australia in the one-day series. He had a mixed bag tour down under as he got out for back-to-back ducks in the first ODIs but bounced back with an unbeaten 74 as India ended the series with a 2-1 loss.

With a stellar career spanning over 15 years, Virat Kohli has cemented his position as one of the greatest cricketers of all time. His impressive records and numerous awards are a testament to his dedication and hard work. Let's dive into his impressive records and achievements across all formats. From the days of a being a young, spike-haired prodigy who led India to an iconic ICC U19 World Cup title win at Kuala Lumpur to 2008, Virat has proven himself to be an epitome of consistency, hardwork, top-level fitness, dedication, aggression and various other traits a top-class sportsperson would have. Having won India some of its biggest matches and spearheaded some of sport's remarkable run-chases, Virat has evolved from just a classy stroke player to something way more: A statistician's delight that keeps everyone dissecting and marvelling at his numbers and a symbol of what Indian cricket is in modern age: Aggressive, in-your-face, resillient, razor sharp technically, filled with trophies to the brim and most importanly, a brand that has elevated the sport of cricket to people and places unknown. Right from his international debut in 2008, Virat has represented India in 118 matches, scoring 9,040 runs at an average of 47.83 with 29 centuries and 31 fifties to his name and a best score of 254*. He is the fourth-highest run-getter and century maker for India in Tests. Virat's Test career has witnessed plenty of ups and downs. His form from 2016-2019 is among the greatest peaks in the longest format, having made 4,208 runs in 43 Tests and 69 innings at an average of 66.79, with 16 centuries and 10 fifties. It was during this period he smashed seven double centuries, the most by a captain in Tests, a record which still stands. Virat, the Test captain, remains one of the biggest ambassadors for the long format. India's most successful Test captain ever, he led India to 40 wins in 68 Tests, losing just 17 and drawing 11. His win percentage stood at above 58. His impact as a Test captain goes beyond the numbers. Development of a highly strict, no-nonsense fitness culture, hunger to win, a never-say die attitude, a number of landmark overseas wins and development of a huge bench strength of fast bowlers contributed to India's streak of three ICC World Test Championship (WTC) mace wins from 2017-19 and their qualification for WTC final in 2021 and 2023 when it was turned into a full-fledged league competition. ODIs remain Virat's best format and he arguably is the greatest to grace the format. In 295 ODIs, he has scored 13,906 runs at an average of 58.18, with 50 centuries and 72 fifties. His best score is 183 in this format. He is the third-highest run-getter in ODIs and second-highest among Indians. Virat is the only player to have had scored 50 centuries in ODIs, going past Sachin Tendulkar's record during the World Cup 2023 semifinal against New Zealand last year at Wankhede Stadium, right in front of Sachin, a man he grew up idolising, like millions of kids. The 'King Kohli' has showcased his best in the 50-over format, owning plenty of records. He is the fastest player to have reached 8,000 runs (175 innings), 9,000 runs (194 innings), 10,000 runs (205 innings), 11,000 runs (222 innings), 12,000 runs (242 runs) and 13,000 runs (267 innings). Virat is a \"chasemaster\" in 50-over format to the core, scoring most runs and centuries in successful run-chases. In 102 such matches, he has scored 5,786 runs at a marvellous average of 90.40, with 23 tons and 25 fifties to his name in 96 innings. He holds record for most runs in an ODI bilateral series, with 558 runs coming at an average of 186.00 in six matches against South Africa in 2017-18 season, with three centuries and a fifty. His best score was 160*. Virat has been a part of the team which won the ICC Cricket World Cup (2011) and ICC Champions Trophy (2013) and ended as runners-up of ICC Cricket World Cup (2023) after a 10-match win streak and a heartbreaking loss to Australia in the final. Though he delivered many memorable knocks in these tournaments, the WC 2023 is his peak as an ODI batter. He ended the tournament as the 'Player of the Tournament' with 765 runs in 11 matches at an average of 95.62, with three centuries and six fifties. His best score was 117. In 50-over World Cup history, Virat is the second-highest run-getter with 1,795 runs in 37 matches at an average of 69.83, with five centuries and 12 fifties. In ICC Champions Trophy, Virat has scored 529 runs in 13 matches at an average of 88.16 and five fifties to his name in 12 innings. He was also a fine ODI captain, having won 65 out of 95 ODIs he led the team in, losing 27 and tying one. He took the team to runners-up finish in ICC Champions Trophy 2017 and semifinal of 50-over World Cup in 2019. Coming to T20Is, Virat scored 4,188 runs in 125 T20Is and 117 innings at an average of 48.69, with a century and 38 fifties to his name.

Africa by 52 runs to win the Women’s ODI World Cup 2025 title. | Photo Credit: EMMANUAL YOGINI On the eve of the final, a reporter asked India captain Harmanpreet Kaur how she would celebrate if her side won the World Cup. “For big occasions, you don’t have to plan anything because we have visualised it and dreamt about it so many times. It’s only about what you remember and what comes out when it happens,” she gushed with a big smile on her face. A little over 24 hours later, with a capacity crowd carrying the team in its chants and prayers well past midnight, the Indian women’s team created history as it beat South Africa by 52 runs in the Women’s ODI World Cup 2025 final to clinch its maiden ICC crown. Chasing a stiff 299-run target, Laura Wolvaardt knew she needed to be the backbone of the fight. Chasing a stiff 299-run target, Laura Wolvaardt knew she needed to be the backbone of the fight. | Photo Credit: EMMANUAL YOGINI While Wolvaardt looked solid, India sank its teeth into the batting order at the other end, sending a shaky Tazmin Brits back within the PowerPlay. Shafali Verma, an inspired bowling change, repaid her captain’s faith stunningly, dismissing Sune Luus off her second ball in World Cup cricket. A delighted Harmanpreet leapt into Shafali’s arms as the 21-year-old carried her captain around the wicket in celebration. She would go on to remove her Delhi Capitals teammate Marizanne Kapp as well, who, in all likelihood, has played her last ODI World Cup. Desperate for partners, Wolvaardt found an ally in Annerie Dercksen, whose spirited six-hitting eased the frayed South African nerves. India’s Deepti Sharma picked a scintillating fifer, starting with the prized scalp of Wolvaardt before cleaning up the tail to lead India to a win. | Photo Credit: EMMANUAL YOGINI Wolvaardt slowly brought up a second consecutive hundred, a knock of the highest quality under immense pressure. Any joy was short-lived as Deepti Sharma’s onslaught began. A scintillating fifer followed, starting with the prized scalp of Wolvaardt before cleaning up a tail struggling to survive. It came down to 53 runs needed from the last five overs, with the boisterous crowd watching along bated breath. Nadine de Klerk waged a lone battle with South Africa, left with just one wicket in hand to add to the jeopardy. She would have hoped to repeat her heroics from the league stage, but it was too tall a mountain to climb. Earlier, Wolvaardt opted for the comfort of a chase. Smriti Mandhana paired up once more with Shafali, who, until a few days ago, was playing domestic cricket in Surat for Haryana after being cast away from the ODI squad a year ago. Despite losing Smriti early, an almost new-look Shafali motored on. Her quick scoring now came with a side of calmness, as she chose to play along the ground rather than recklessly going aerial. She hacked down a half-century and looked set to go for the ton when old habits kicked in, holing out to Sune Luus at mid-off off Ayabonga Khaka in the 28th over. Wickets, however, fell in the slog overs, as it often does with India. The side turned to Deepti for some magic. She linked up with Richa Ghosh to turn the heat back on the Proteas, with a solid half-century. An Indian total once headed well past 300 fell short, but all that was to be eventually forgotten as the raucous celebrations ringing in India’s coronation went well into the night.

The hosts had made the final after pulling off a seemingly improbable win against defending champions Australia. Having conceded 338 in the first innings, an unbeaten 127 from Jemimah Rodrigues and 89 from Harmanpreet Kaur saw India reach their target with nine balls to spare. It ended a run of 15 consecutive Australia wins in Women’s World Cups. Advertisement In Sunday’s final, India, put into bat by South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt, got off well thanks to a 104-run opening stand between Smriti Mandhana (45) and Shafali Verma, who top-scored with a 78-ball 87 to be named player of the match. South Africa fought back in the middle overs, but Sharma’s run-a-ball 58 and some power hitting from Richa Ghosh (34 off 24) lifted them to 298/7 in 50 overs. Ayabonga Khaka finished with 3/58 from her nine overs. In response, South Africa began slowly but picked up pace before Tazmin Brits was run out by an Amanjot Kaur direct hit. Anneke Bosch, who dropped two catches in the first innings, ended a nightmare performance by falling for a six-ball duck.

Indian skipper Harmanpreet turned to part-timer Verma, who, having shone with the bat, dismissed experienced duo Sune Luus (25) and Marizanne Kapp (four) to reduce South Africa to 123/4. Wolvaardt continued to hold her end up, scoring a century to become just the second player after Healy to score 100 runs in both the semi-final and final of a women’s World Cup after a match-winning 169 in the last-four clash against England. Annerie Dercksen stitched a 61-run stand with her after South Africa fell to 148/5, but was dismissed for 35 by Sharma, who won the player of the tournament award. Wolvaardt followed in Sharma’s next over, with Amanjot juggling a difficult chance twice at deep mid-wicket before clinging on with one hand. Sharma then dismissed Chloe Tyron and Nadine de Klerk, who led South Africa’s comeback win over India in the league phase, to complete her five-wicket haul (5/39), becoming the first player to score a half-century and take three or more wickets in a World Cup final. Ultimately, Ghosh’s hits in the final overs of the first innings, India’s chokehold in the middle overs while bowling, and some tremendous ground fielding and catching compared to South Africa’s errors on the field, resulted in a historic victory.

Opening batter Verma, who was only called back into the squad as injury cover for the finals, scored a career-best 87 off 78 balls as the tournament co-host reached 298-7 in 50 overs after losing the toss and being sent in to bat. South Africa was out for 246 in 45.3 overs in reply with its chase effectively over after skipper Laura Wolvaardt was out for 101. Spinner Sharma took the final wicket of the match and returned bowling figures of 5-39 from 9.3 overs. “We were waiting for this moment, and now this moment has come,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said, reflecting on a triumph after two previous finals defeats. “Now we want to make this a habit.” India was the last of the four teams to qualify for the semifinals, but then beat defending champion and seven-time winner Australia by five wickets to reach the final. South Africa beat four-time champion England by 125 runs to reach the final for the first time. Winning at home gave India its first major women’s cricket title. Harmanpreet Kaur’s squad was the first, first-time champion since 2000, when New Zealand ended the long dominance of Australia and England.

Follow on Player of the match Verma – who was drafted in last week for the injured Pratika Rawal – took 2-36 with the ball and was voted player of the match. “God sent me to do something good, and that was reflected today,” the 21-year-old Verma said. “I only focused on making runs today. My mind was clear.” Player of the tournament Before her five-wicket haul, Sharma (58) posted her third half-century of the tournament to help India reached the second highest total in a World Cup final after Australia’s 356-5 against England in 2022. She finished the tournament with 22 wickets and 215 runs in nine matches to capture the player of the tournament honors. “I enjoyed myself with both bat and ball,” Sharma said of the final. “We were not relaxed at any time, but we were calm. I dedicate this trophy to my parents.” Wolvaardt’s ton Wolvaardt a fine century on the back of her impressive semifinal performance . She was easily the tournament’s highest scorer with 571 runs at an average 71.37. Sedate start Chasing a record 299, South Africa made a sedate start under immense pressure from medium pacer Renuka Singh. Wolvaardt shared a 51-run first-wicket stand before a direct throw from Amanjot Kaur ran out and Tazmin Brits for 23 in the 10th over. Anneke Bosche was bowled for a duck before Wolvaardt reached her half-century off 45 balls. She added 52 off 51 balls with Sune Luus, who scored 25. India lost its review in desperation to get Wolvaardt dismissed, and then gambled with Verma’s gentle off-breakers. The ploy worked with another double blow – Verma picked up two wickets in six deliveries to have South Africa in trouble at 123-4 in 22.1 overs. She sent back Luus with an easy return catch, and then had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind. Wolvaardt tried to keep the chase alive through partnerships with Sinalo Jafta (16) and Annerie Dercksen, who scored 35. In doing so, she reached a century off 96 balls.

But in her small town of Rohtak, in the north Indian state of Haryana, cricket was not a game for girls. Aged nine, desperate to play, she cut her hair short, entered a tournament disguised as her brother, and went on to win man of the match. Verma’s determined father, Sanjeev, in the face of refusal from every cricket academy or training centre who would not accept his daughter, enrolled her as a boy. “Luckily, nobody noticed,” he recalled , as Verma made her debut for the national women’s team at 15 years old. On Sunday, Verma stood triumphantly with her teammates as they held aloft the Women’s Cricket World Cup , making history as the first Indian women’s national team to win the cup – and for equality. The struggles and sacrifices made for years by the women to get here – defying social stigma, a lack of resources and juggling manual jobs between training – made their win even more extraordinary. View image in fullscreen Shafali Verma played her first cricket tournament disguised as her brother. Photograph: Unnati Naidu/SPP/Shutterstock It came at a critical turning point for women’s cricket in India, where the sport verges on a national religion, is a multibillion dollar industry but also widely regarded as a “gentleman’s game”. It was only in 2017 that female cricketers were given full-time professional contracts and a women’s premier league (WPL) established in 2023. Varnika Choudhary, who plays for the Uttar Pradesh state under-23s women’s team, described how her small village of Beerakheri had always been very resistant to her playing cricket and it had taken two years to convince her parents to let her play. Even as the cricket-crazy village regularly gathered to watch the Indian premier league (IPL) and Men’s Cricket World Cup, women’s professional cricket was widely ignored. But this time, said Choudhary, the whole village sat in the square to watch the Women’s World Cup final on Sunday. “Everyone in my village got so excited when they won,” she said. “They were all sending me photos and reels and messages saying: ‘This will be you winning for India one day.’” Many in her village had been particularly impressed by Verma’s batting. “They told me, wow she’s hitting like a man,” said Choudhary. “I had to correct them and say, no she’s hitting like a woman.” Hundreds of millions of people across India tuned in to watch the final and Choudhary was among the many who saw the win as a pivotal moment, not just for women’s cricket but for women in India more broadly, and their battle for equality in the country’s still deeply patriarchal society. Though more women in India are being educated, they endure heavy societal burdens on how they are expected to behave and present themselves in public and are uniformly lower paid across all sectors. “More women playing cricket changes everything, not just in the sport,” Choudhary said. “We feel independent, we feel we are doing something for ourselves and that society can finally see us equal to the men.” View image in fullscreen The winners of this year’s Women’s Cricket World Cup celebrate after the match. Photograph: Unnati Naidu/SPP/Shutterstock Sharda Ugra, one of India’s foremost cricket writers, said the significance of the match went beyond cricket. “For Indian women in the public space, your body is usually seen as a source of honour or shame,” she said. “So to see these girls – who mostly come from rural small towns – running around, sweaty, shouting, screaming and uninhibited about what they looked like, sent a very powerful message. It was quite wonderful to see.” The national team, led by the captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, have become Indian sporting royaltyafter their win, and this week were hosted at the residence of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The significance of their triumph for women in India was widely acknowledged by the team, who paid tribute to the female cricketers who had paved the way before them. Without this trophy, said Kaur after the match, “the revolution, the change we want, won’t come”. Ugra said she believed the win would trigger “a mass movement towards making cricket a sport that girls play for leisure, for enjoyment, as a profession”, but emphasised that women’s cricket still had a long ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/07/india-women-cricket-world-cup-win-victory-equality", "domain": "theguardian.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 7408}, {"source_number": 5, "title": "ICC Women 's World Cup : Jemimah Rodrigues, from the fringe to the...", "snippet": "A win for India would transform women 's cricket globally, much as happened when Kapil Dev's unheralded team beat the West Indies in 1983.

For defending champions Australia, seven-time winners and unbeaten in this tournament, it was a shattering end to a 16-match unbeaten World Cup streak stretching back to 2022. At the heart of India's stunning win was Rodrigues - the batter from Mumbai whose unbeaten 127 from 134 balls demonstrated self-belief, skill, and tactical brilliance in a daunting run chase. India stun Australia in record chase to reach final India's fiercest nemesis, the giants of women's cricket, were finally toppled. With Australia out, there will be a new name on the trophy on Sunday. Alex Davidson-ICC/ICC via Getty Images Ash Gardner has been one of Australia's strongest batters through the tournament Rodrigues' maiden World Cup century helped India go past the twists, turns and hurdles during the run chase. After the match, experts hailed it as the greatest ODI century in women's cricket in the greatest run chase the format has seen. Few have disagreed. It was a masterclass from Rodrigues - in both conception and execution. Her reading of the ebb and flow of play, especially during testing passages, was superb. The ability to find gaps in the field, the innovative strokes that disrupt the rhythm of the bowlers and flummoxed fielders, the swift running between the wickets, the capacity to up the strike rate when needed, showcased a batter in commanding form. What her composure and sublime form didn't show was the turmoil Rodrigues had been battling before and during the tournament. It's an irony now that Rodrigues wasn't in India's original World Cup plans - her selection came only after much debate. PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues' steady stand anchored India's famous win After the match, Rodrigues admitted to battling anxiety through the tournament - uncertain about her place, her role, and her future after being dropped. \"I relied on Jesus to help me out of the mental crisis,\" she said. Faith may move mountains - in Rodrigues's case, it silenced the demons in her head and steadied her focus. On her return to the playing XI against a tough New Zealand side, she scored a stroke-filled unbeaten 65. But a far bigger challenge awaited her in the semi-final. Australia, choosing to bat first, notched up 338, fired by a brutal 119 off just 93 deliveries by 22-year-old opener Phoebe Litchfield and her 155-run partnership for the second wicket with veteran Ellyse Perry. When these two were together, Australia looked set to score 375 or more, but India's bowlers pulled back things, preventing the situation from spinning out of control. Nonetheless, 338 looked an imposing score to overhaul against the all-powerful Australia side, and India looked to have fallen into a familiar hole when hard-hitting Shefali Verma and classy, in-form Smriti Mandhana, fell within 10 overs. That is when Rodrigues, promoted to number three in the batting order, took charge to change the trajectory of the match and redefine her team's fortune and her own career. A brisk start showcased her intent. Assuming the role of senior partner, she nursed captain Harmanpreet Kaur through her early tense phase. As nerves settled, the duo grew in confidence, adding 167 for the third wicket and bringing India within sight of victory. It wasn't a cakewalk - the Aussies fought hard, but the defending champions finally cracked. India matched their skill and intensity, and surpassed their famed resilience. They shattered a psychological barrier in an exhilarating style, showing grit, commitment, and nerves of steel. Getty Images Phoebe Litchfield's blazing start powered Australia's innings Rodrigues couldn't keep her emotions in check after the match, nor could captain Harmanpreet, who had made a superb 89 in a partnership that helped India pull off the stunning upset. There was some element of good fortune in India's passage into the final. New Zealand, for instance, suffered badly at the hands of bad weather which cost them valuable points. In the semi-final, Rodrigues had a couple of chances (on 82 and 107) as Australia uncharacteristically dropped sitters. But all said, India's place in the final was well-deserved: for the quality of cricket they have played, as well as the burning desire they have shown.

India beat South Africa by 52 runs to win the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 final at the Dr. DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, claiming their first-ever World Cup crown. Deepti Sharma and Shafali Verma starred with both bat and ball to help India secure a tense win after South Africa had won the toss and elected to bowl. Chasing 299, South Africa looked well set at one stage to get to the target but Deepti Sharma’s breakthrough sparked a dramatic collapse. After she dismissed Annerie Dercksen, the Proteas crumbled from 209/5 to 246 all out. Captain Laura Wolvaardt (101) led from the front with a magnificent century but wickets fell regularly at the other end. Deepti was the standout performer with the ball, finishing with superb figures of 5/39 while Shafali Verma and Sree Charani chipped in with key wickets to seal a historic win for India. India clinch their maiden World Cup title | CWC25 Watch India's historic moment of winning their first ODI World Cup title as Harmanpreet Kaur holds onto the final catch. Deepti Sharma had turned the tide for India with a brilliant spell that yielded three crucial wickets, including that of South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt, who had kept her side in the hunt with a valiant century. But Deepti’s double strike in a single over that included the wickets of Wolvaardt and Chloe Tryon came at a decisive stage, just as the required run rate began to climb, leaving South Africa under mounting pressure. Laura Wolvaardt's valiant century | Player Highlights | CWC25 Watch South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt's highlights from her knock during the the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Final clash between India and South Africa. Earlier, Wolvaardt and Annerie Dercksen had offered resistance with a fifty-run stand, steering the Proteas past the 200-run mark after a mini collapse had left them reeling at 148/5. Deepti had earlier triggered that slide by dismissing Sinalo Jafta, following up on Shafali Verma’s impactful spell where she claimed two wickets in as many overs. Verma had shifted the momentum India’s way by striking twice in quick succession, first removing Sune Luus in her opening over following up with the prized wicket of Marizanne Kapp in her next over. That double blow tightened India’s grip on the contest before Jafta’s dismissal deepened South Africa’s troubles. Amanjot's juggling catch removes Wolvaardt | CWC25 Amanjot Kaur takes the all-important catch of Laura Wolvaardt as India pounce back into the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 Final. India’s first breakthrough came through sharp fielding when Tazmin Brits was run out by a direct hit from Amanjot Kaur at the non-striker’s end. Brits and Wolvaardt had given South Africa a solid foundation with a fifty-run opening stand in the powerplay, putting the pressure on India’s bowlers early in the chase. Sree Charani then struck in her first over to trap Anneke Bosch plumb in front. Despite the quick wickets, Wolvaardt continued to anchor the innings, guiding South Africa past 100 alongside Sune Luus. Sensing the need for a breakthrough, captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s decision to bring Verma into the attack proved game-changing. The opener’s twin strikes turned the momentum in India’s favour, setting the stage for Deepti Sharma’s match-defining spell that ultimately put India in control. Shafali Verma's twin strikes | CWC25 Watch Shafali Verma getting two wickets of as many overs during ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Final clash between India and South Africa. In the first innings, India put up 298/7 against South Africa, posting the second-highest score in a Women's ODI World Cup final. After a commanding 100-run opening stand, India were well placed at 223/3 but South Africa fought back to keep them below the 300 mark. Shafali Verma (87) led the way with a fine knock while Deepti Sharma (58) steadied the innings towards the end. Richa Ghosh (34) added a lively cameo that gave India late momentum. For South Africa, Ayabonga Khaka (3/58) was the standout performer with the ball while Nonkululeko Mlaba, Nadine de Klerk and Chloe Tryon picked up a wicket each.

On a historic Sunday night, Harmanpreet Kaur’s fearless brigade rose to the occasion, defeating a determined South Africa by 52 runs amid thunderous cheers from a packed Dr DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. For years, heartbreak had defined India’s story — Karen Rolton’s century crushed their dreams in 2005 at Centurion, and Anya Shrubsole’s magical six-for broke millions of hearts at Lord’s in 2017. But in 2025, the script changed forever. With Shafali Verma’s fire and Deepti Sharma’s composure under pressure, India finally conquered the stage that had long eluded them, clinching their maiden ICC title and joining New Zealand, Australia, and England as ODI world champions. advertisement As the final wicket fell, the field erupted in pure emotion. Harmanpreet Kaur roared in triumph, tears glistening in her eyes — a cry that echoed two decades of unfulfilled dreams. And up in the stands, Rohit Sharma, who had felt the sting of heartbreak in the 2023 final, stood and applauded — a gesture that captured the nation’s pride, relief, and joy all at once.

SHAFALI SETS THE PLATFORM Shafali Verma scored 87 runs and picked up 2 wickets. Courtesy: Reuters After being asked to bat first, India posted 298 for seven on a surface that wasn’t particularly easy for batting. Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma gave the innings a solid start with a 104-run stand off 17.4 overs — the highest opening partnership against the Proteas in the ongoing edition of the mega event. Shafali, under pressure after her failure against Australia, responded in style by becoming the youngest batter, male or female, to score a fifty in the history of ODI World Cups. She reached her half-century in 49 balls and went on to record her highest individual score in World Cups. Mandhana, on the other hand, was watchful early on but soon found her rhythm, compiling 45 off 58 deliveries. India vs South Africa, Women's World Cup final Scorecard Mandhana fell against the run of play when Chloe Tryon broke the stand, bringing Jemimah Rodrigues to the middle. Jemimah and Shafali then added 62 runs for the second wicket. Just as Shafali looked set for her maiden ODI century, Ayobonga Khaka dismissed her when she holed out to Sune Luus while attempting to go over the top. Shafali’s fluent 87 off 78 balls included seven fours and two sixes. INDIA STRUGGLE AT DEATH Ayobonga Khaka picked up 3 wickets. Courtesy: Reuters Harmanpreet Kaur (20) and Jemimah (24) couldn’t reproduce their magic from the Australia clash, falling to Nonkululeko Mlaba and Khaka respectively. Deepti Sharma played a patient, run-a-ball 58, but India could muster only 69 runs in the final 10 overs. Deepti struggled with her running and survived two chances after Kapp and Anneke Bosch dropped her, though she couldn’t make the most of those reprieves. In the end, Richa Ghosh’s quick-fire 34 off 24 balls provided the late flourish that pushed India close to the 300-run mark. Richa used her bottom hand to good effect, striking three fours and two sixes before Khaka dismissed her. Khaka was the standout bowler for South Africa with figures of 9-0-58-3. Kapp went wicketless, while Mlaba, Tryon, and de Klerk picked up one wicket apiece. advertisement WOLVAARDT SETS UP THE CHASE Laura Wolvaardt's century went in vain. Courtesy: Reuters South Africa made a cautious start to their run chase as Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits struggled to find rhythm early on, with Renuka Singh and Kranti Goud maintaining tight lines and lengths. However, the pair soon settled in and began to find the boundary with greater ease. Just as the partnership started to flourish, a brilliant direct hit from Amanjot Kaur ended Brits’ innings for 23 off 35 balls, which included two fours and a six.

As India lifted its first-ever ICC Women’s ODI World Cup, one quiet figure in the dugout finally stepped out of the shadows that he had lived in for decades. Amol Muzumdar — the eternal “next man in” — had finally arrived. More than three decades ago, at the fabled Shardashram English School, a young right-hander sat padded up as Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli batted on and on, stitching together their world-record 664-run partnership. Muzumdar never got to face a single ball that day. That moment became a metaphor for his life — always waiting for his turn, always ready, yet never called to the crease of destiny. He did everything a cricketer could. A sparkling 260 not out on Ranji debut forMumbai. More than 11,000 first-class runs at an average of nearly 50. Leadership of Mumbai, and later stints with Assam and Andhra. He shared dressing rooms with Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, and Anil Kumble, but the India cap — that ultimate dream — never came. India’s captain Harmanpreet Kaur touches feet of coach Amol Muzumdar as they celebrate after winning the match during the ICC Women’s World Cup Final match India vs South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Sunday | Photo Credit: EMMANUAL YOGINI And yet, Amol never complained. Not when selectors looked past him. Not when politics in Mumbai’s cricket circles clipped his wings. Not even when critics questioned his appointment as the head coach of the Indian women’s team in 2023 — “How can someone who never played for India coach those who have?” they asked. Amol, calm as ever, said nothing. He let the silence bat for him. Last night, his silence roared. As Harmanpreet Kaur touched his feet and hugged him, Amol’s eyes brimmed with tears. The flag of India fluttered in his hands as the women he had mentored danced in triumph. The stadium echoed with chants of victory — but his victory was deeply personal, achingly poetic. For years, he had been the man left padded up. On Sunday night, he finally walked in — not to bat, but to embrace the moment that had eluded him all his life. A week before his 51st birthday, Amol Muzumdar’s innings has finally began. And this one — this glorious, tear-streaked, tricolor-draped innings — is bound to be unforgettable.

Picture by 2025 Getty Images By Joe Williams 07 November 2025 13:32 GMT+0 3 min read Some triumphs become turning points; others become touchstones of belief. For Balwinder Singh Sandhu , one of the heroes of India’s 1983 World Cup win, watching Harmanpreet Kaur lift the Women’s World Cup 2025 trophy at DY Patil Stadium was not just a celebration – it was a reflection of a moment that once changed Indian cricket forever. “Harmanpreet Kaur is the Kapil Dev of Indian cricket,” Sandhu told Olympics.com, his tone filled with pride and nostalgia. “What Kapil paaji did for us in 1983, Harman has done for her team today. She leads with heart, humility, and conviction – qualities that inspire every player around her.” Sandhu, the man who dismissed Gordon Greenidge with a delivery that became part of cricketing folklore, recalls how the odds were stacked against his team four decades ago. “We weren’t the favourites back then, and neither were they,” Sandhu said. “We had lost two games early in the tournament before Kapil’s 175 against Zimbabwe turned everything around. The women faced the same uphill battle after defeats to Australia and South Africa. But both teams found their way back because their captains believed.” He draws a clear line between the two eras – different times, same spirit. “You could see it in her eyes,” Sandhu said. “That calmness before a storm, the assurance that no matter the situation, the leader would hold the team together. That’s what Kapil did for us. That’s what Harmanpreet has done for them.” But Sandhu’s admiration extends beyond the captain. He speaks with deep respect for Amol Muzumdar, the man behind India’s women’s team’s revival. “Amol’s story is one of patience and perseverance,” Sandhu said. “He didn’t get to play for India, but he never stopped serving Indian cricket. His destiny was to guide, to mentor – and he has done that with remarkable composure. He was a fine batsman, but he’s proved to be an even better coach.” Balwinder Singh Sandhu remembers Muzumdar from his Mumbai days – consistent, disciplined, and quietly determined. “Had he batted higher in the order, his playing career might have been different,” Sandhu reflected. “But perhaps this was how it was meant to be, for him to help others find success where he was denied. That takes character.” As the floodlights glowed over DY Patil Stadium, Sandhu said the emotions were unmistakable. “It felt like Lord’s all over again,” he smiled. “The faces were new, the colours brighter, but the feeling – that same pride of watching India rise, was identical. This isn’t about men’s or women’s cricket anymore. It’s about Indian cricket.” He paused, his voice softening with memory. “In 1983, only a few of us carried small keepsakes from Lord’s,” he said. “But today, every Indian carries a piece of DY Patil in their heart. The women have turned it into our new Lord’s — a field of dreams.” As he signed off, Sandhu summed it up best: “Hat’s off to Harmanpreet and her girls. They’ve written their own golden chapter.

The summit clash took place on Sunday, November 2, at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, where India defeated South Africa by 52 runs after posting 298 on the board to clinch their maiden World Cup title. Ad Reacting to the triumph during a discussion on his YouTube channel on Monday, November 3, Ashwin stated that the women’s team was ready to make history, and that’s why they got a coach like Amol Muzumdar . He further noted that the past two years have been remarkable for Indian cricket, with the men’s team winning the 2024 T20 World Cup under Rahul Dravid and the women’s team now scripting history under Amol Muzumdar. The 39-year-old said: Ad Trending “‘When the student is ready, the guru arrives.’ This Indian team, their captain and senior players, were all ready. Ready to create history. And that’s why they got such a guru. You mentioned Amol Muzumdar, right? You directly connected it with Chak De! India and Shah Rukh Khan. But I actually want to explain sports in a real way. These years, 2024 and 2025, are truly great years in Indian cricketing history. You know why? Because I always feel that good people, genuinely good people, don’t get enough compliments.” Ad “Good things do happen for good people. Rahul Dravid and Amol Muzumdar, Rahul Dravid as coach won the 2024 World Cup. Amol Muzumdar as coach won the 2025 Women’s World Cup. That’s such a significant example for all the good men, good women, good people out there, those who are honest from within, who genuinely want to do good work but often don’t get the credit. For them, this is proof that good men don’t always finish last. Good things happen for good people,” he added. Ad Meanwhile, Shafali Verma was named Player of the Match in the final for her all-round performance, scoring 87 runs and taking two wickets. “Unbelievable achievement” - Amol Muzumdar on India winning Women’s World Cup 2025 As India defeated South Africa to win the Women’s World Cup 2025 on November 2, head coach Amol Muzumdar expressed immense pride and joy. Speaking to the broadcaster after the match, he said (as quoted by ESPNcricinfo ): Ad “Absolutely proud. I don't know, it has not yet sunk in. Unbelievable achievement and they deserve every credit and everything that will follow from here. They have worked terribly hard. They have done every Indian proud. We did not look at those losses as losses, we looked at them as we could not get over the line. We dominated the majority of those matches, and we just thought there are some hiccups.” Ad “We were still alive in the tournament and here we are, as world champions. I know for a fact that they have worked extremely hard for this, and it is a watershed moment for Indian cricket. (One word on Shafali) Magical. Turns up in the semi final. In the final, packed ground, turns up with a magical innings, and then with the ball. That was one thing we spoke a lot about in the dressing room. Fielding and fitness was something we spoke about. They just turned it up on this day in the World Cup final - I could not have asked for more,” he added. Before this historic triumph, India had reached the ODI World Cup final twice in 2005 and 2017 but fell short on both occasions under the leadership of Mithali Raj . × Was this article helpful?

India beat South Africa by 52 runs to clinch maiden title Saurav Goyal • India’s women’s cricket team has created history by lifting their first-ever ICC Women’s ODI World Cup trophy. In the final at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, the Women in Blue defeated South Africa by 52 runs to script a golden chapter in Indian cricket. Add The Sporting News as a preferred news source How did India’s innings unfold in the World Cup final? After a brief rain delay that pushed the start by nearly two hours, India got off to a flying start. Openers Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana set the tone early and took on the bowlers fearlessly. Shafali, recalled to the side for the knockout rounds, played the innings of her life, a brilliant 87 off 78 balls. Smriti supported her beautifully and scored 45 runs before falling to Chloe Tryon. Together, the duo stitched a crucial century stand that gave India the momentum they needed. Deepti Sharma then stepped up with a fluent 58 off 58 balls and kept the scoreboard ticking. Richa Ghosh’s late cameo, 34 runs from just 24 balls, helped India post an imposing total of 298 for 7 in their 50 overs.

Chasing 299 in a World Cup final was never going to be easy. South Africa’s openers, Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits, started steadily, adding valuable runs early on. But India struck quickly. Amanjot Kaur’s sharp throw caught Brits short of her crease, and that triggered a collapse. Anneke Bosch fell soon after, trapped in front by young Sree Charani. Harmanpreet Kaur’s captaincy brilliance came to the fore when she introduced part-timer Shafali Verma into the attack and the gamble worked instantly. Shafali dismissed both Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp, swinging the momentum completely in India’s favour. Despite Wolvaardt’s fighting effort, South Africa never quite recovered. In the end, South Africa were bowled out well short, handing India a historic 52-run victory.

The hosts had made the final after pulling off a seemingly improbable win against defending champions Australia. Having conceded 338 in the first innings, an unbeaten 127 from Jemimah Rodrigues and 89 from Harmanpreet Kaur saw India reach their target with nine balls to spare. It ended a run of 15 consecutive Australia wins in Women’s World Cups. Advertisement In Sunday’s final, India, put into bat by South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt, got off well thanks to a 104-run opening stand between Smriti Mandhana (45) and Shafali Verma, who top-scored with a 78-ball 87 to be named player of the match. South Africa fought back in the middle overs, but Sharma’s run-a-ball 58 and some power hitting from Richa Ghosh (34 off 24) lifted them to 298/7 in 50 overs. Ayabonga Khaka finished with 3/58 from her nine overs. In response, South Africa began slowly but picked up pace before Tazmin Brits was run out by an Amanjot Kaur direct hit. Anneke Bosch, who dropped two catches in the first innings, ended a nightmare performance by falling for a six-ball duck.

Indian skipper Harmanpreet turned to part-timer Verma, who, having shone with the bat, dismissed experienced duo Sune Luus (25) and Marizanne Kapp (four) to reduce South Africa to 123/4. Wolvaardt continued to hold her end up, scoring a century to become just the second player after Healy to score 100 runs in both the semi-final and final of a women’s World Cup after a match-winning 169 in the last-four clash against England. Annerie Dercksen stitched a 61-run stand with her after South Africa fell to 148/5, but was dismissed for 35 by Sharma, who won the player of the tournament award. Wolvaardt followed in Sharma’s next over, with Amanjot juggling a difficult chance twice at deep mid-wicket before clinging on with one hand. Sharma then dismissed Chloe Tyron and Nadine de Klerk, who led South Africa’s comeback win over India in the league phase, to complete her five-wicket haul (5/39), becoming the first player to score a half-century and take three or more wickets in a World Cup final. Ultimately, Ghosh’s hits in the final overs of the first innings, India’s chokehold in the middle overs while bowling, and some tremendous ground fielding and catching compared to South Africa’s errors on the field, resulted in a historic victory.

The showpiece event in front of a raucous, sold-out 45,000 crowd was delayed by two hours because of rain but no overs were lost and a match for the ages played out in Navi Mumbai. The hosts batted first and posted a competitive 298-7 - opener Shafali Verma led the charge with a dynamic 87 from 78 balls, backed up by Deepti Sharma's 58, which set the Proteas their record one-day international run-chase. Captain Laura Wolvaardt scored her second successive century, a flawless 101 from 98 balls, which kept South Africa in contention at 211-6 and needing 88 from the final 10 overs. But her dismissal, via a juggling catch from Amanjot Kaur at deep mid-wicket off Deepti in the 42nd over, sparked India's charge to victory and even with the game finishing after midnight local time, the packed crowd stayed and roared until the very last ball. The emotions were contrasting for South Africa, who finished 246 all out which confirmed their third successive final defeat, having lost the previous two T20 finals. Verma, who was only called up for the semi-finals after an injury to Pratika Rawal, added figures of 2-36 to her knock to also become an unlikely hero with the ball but it was Deepti, the tournament's leading wicket-taker, who ripped through the Proteas batters to finish with 5-39 as bedlam unfolded. It completes an incredible turnaround for India, who lost three consecutive group-stage games before their march to glory. The scenes at the DY Patil Stadium suggested this triumph will ignite a new era in the women's game.

This video can not be played Media caption, 'Could that be the moment that changes this final?' - Luus is caught and bowled by Verma This was a final of two teams familiar with near-misses - India in 2017 and at the T20 edition in 2020, and South Africa with their defeats by Australia and New Zealand in the shorter format in 2023 and 2024. For India in particular, though, with their cricket-loving nation and the domination of their men's side, it always felt like a matter of when and not if they would conquer the world. This was billed as the tournament that could change the world order of women's cricket and it had its obstacles - a slow start, one-sided games, washouts and crucially, India losing three games in a row to leave their semi-final place in some jeopardy. But it was that astonishing semi-final win against favourites Australia, at this same venue, which turned the tide and had crowds queuing outside the ground more than 24 hours out from the first ball, scrambling for tickets. The Women's Premier League, India's franchise T20 tournament, has been instrumental in improving their depth and giving them the experience of playing in front of big crowds, which had all built up to this moment. Australia have been the dominant force of women's cricket in the last decade, at times looking unstoppable, but this is likely to be a moment that is referred to in years to come as when the sport changed - just as it was when the men won their equivalent for the first time under Kapil Dev in 1983.

This video can not be played Media caption, Best shots from Verma's 'terrific' innings against South Africa With both teams vying for their first World Cup title, the pre-match talk was all about who could handle the occasion – India faced with enormous expectation, contrasted with whether South Africa could use the underdog tag in their favour. With rain washing out any hopes of starting on time, it was inevitable the captain who won the toss would bowl first but the Navi Mumbai surface remained batter-friendly as it had been in India's high-scoring semi-final against Australia, exemplified by Smriti Mandhana and Verma calmly cruising to 64-0 in the powerplay. It was actually South Africa's bowlers who appeared consumed by the occasion as they bowled too wide to the openers, who reeled off the boundaries with ease, before Mandhana was caught behind off Chloe Tryon and Verma chipped Ayabonga Khaka to mid-off.

India beat South Africa by 52 runs to win the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 final at the Dr. DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, claiming their first-ever World Cup crown. Deepti Sharma and Shafali Verma starred with both bat and ball to help India secure a tense win after South Africa had won the toss and elected to bowl. Chasing 299, South Africa looked well set at one stage to get to the target but Deepti Sharma’s breakthrough sparked a dramatic collapse. After she dismissed Annerie Dercksen, the Proteas crumbled from 209/5 to 246 all out. Captain Laura Wolvaardt (101) led from the front with a magnificent century but wickets fell regularly at the other end. Deepti was the standout performer with the ball, finishing with superb figures of 5/39 while Shafali Verma and Sree Charani chipped in with key wickets to seal a historic win for India.

Deepti Sharma had turned the tide for India with a brilliant spell that yielded three crucial wickets, including that of South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt, who had kept her side in the hunt with a valiant century. But Deepti’s double strike in a single over that included the wickets of Wolvaardt and Chloe Tryon came at a decisive stage, just as the required run rate began to climb, leaving South Africa under mounting pressure. Laura Wolvaardt's valiant century | Player Highlights | CWC25 Watch South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt's highlights from her knock during the the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Final clash between India and South Africa. Earlier, Wolvaardt and Annerie Dercksen had offered resistance with a fifty-run stand, steering the Proteas past the 200-run mark after a mini collapse had left them reeling at 148/5. Deepti had earlier triggered that slide by dismissing Sinalo Jafta, following up on Shafali Verma’s impactful spell where she claimed two wickets in as many overs. Verma had shifted the momentum India’s way by striking twice in quick succession, first removing Sune Luus in her opening over following up with the prized wicket of Marizanne Kapp in her next over. That double blow tightened India’s grip on the contest before Jafta’s dismissal deepened South Africa’s troubles. Amanjot's juggling catch removes Wolvaardt | CWC25 Amanjot Kaur takes the all-important catch of Laura Wolvaardt as India pounce back into the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 Final. India’s first breakthrough came through sharp fielding when Tazmin Brits was run out by a direct hit from Amanjot Kaur at the non-striker’s end. Brits and Wolvaardt had given South Africa a solid foundation with a fifty-run opening stand in the powerplay, putting the pressure on India’s bowlers early in the chase. Sree Charani then struck in her first over to trap Anneke Bosch plumb in front. Despite the quick wickets, Wolvaardt continued to anchor the innings, guiding South Africa past 100 alongside Sune Luus. Sensing the need for a breakthrough, captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s decision to bring Verma into the attack proved game-changing. The opener’s twin strikes turned the momentum in India’s favour, setting the stage for Deepti Sharma’s match-defining spell that ultimately put India in control.

In the first innings, India put up 298/7 against South Africa, posting the second-highest score in a Women's ODI World Cup final. After a commanding 100-run opening stand, India were well placed at 223/3 but South Africa fought back to keep them below the 300 mark. Shafali Verma (87) led the way with a fine knock while Deepti Sharma (58) steadied the innings towards the end. Richa Ghosh (34) added a lively cameo that gave India late momentum.

( Getty Images: Alex Davidson ) Skip to timeline India has won its maiden ODI Women's World Cup, defeating South Africa by 52 runs in a pulsating epic in Navi Mumbai. Inspired by all-round performances from Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma, the tournament co-hosts overcame a sublime, fighting century from South African captain Laura Wolvaardt to claim victory in the first final to feature neither England nor Australia. Wolvaardt anchored the South African innings and the game was as good as won when she was dismissed in the 42nd over, caught deep in the outfield by a juggling Armanjot Kaur. Before that, India was put on its path to victory by 21-year-old Verma, who smashed an authoritative 87 and then claimed two wickets in consecutive overs. Wolvaardt was sublime in Navi Mumbai. ( Getty Images: Alex Davidson/ICC ) After rain had delayed the start of play by two hours, South Africa captain Wolvaardt won the toss and made the seemingly obvious decision to send India in. But the tournament co-hosts flew out of the blocks, with openers Smrti Mandhana and Verma combining for a domineering 104-run partnership. Star seamer Marizanne Kapp struggled to get any movement through the air or off the pitch, while up the other end, Ayabonga Khaka was expensive in the first ten overs. However, South Africa asserted itself in the contest with the introduction of pace bowling all-rounder Nadine De Klerk as well as spinners Nonkululeko Mlaba and Chloe Tryon. Tryon prised the Proteas' first wicked in the 18th over, when Smrti was caught behind for 45, before Khaka, much improved on her return to the attack, had Verma caught at mid-off for her outstanding 87. The heroes from Thursdays semifinal win over Australia, Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet Kaur, both made starts at No. 3 and 4, but were dismissed for 20 and 24 before Sharma anchored the back end of the innings with a run a ball 58. Hard-hitting wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh (34) smashed two massive sixes in a rearguard cameo as India finished its innings on 7-298. Rodrigues was dismissed cheaply in Navi Mumbai. ( Getty Images: Pankaj Nangia ) South Africa began its chase positively, with India requiring a moment of inspiration in the field to break Wolvaardt and Tasmin Brits's opening stand. Attempting an ill-advised single after striking the ball directly to mid-on, Brits (23) was well short of her ground as Amanjot Kaur threw down the stumps brilliantly. Anneke Bosch (0) came and went quickly before Sune Luus and the impregnable Wolvaardt combined for a steadying 52 run partnership. But the game turned when part-timer Verma was thrown the ball. Verma — who had an ODI bowling average of 76 before today -—had Luus (25) caught and bowled with her second delivery before strangling South African talisman Kapp (4) down the leg side in her next over. Down the other end, Wolvaardt was quietly making her way to a nerveless final century. She brought up the milestone in the 40th over, but didn't last long after that, holing out to Sharma in the 42nd, before De Klerk (18) was run out and Sharma claimed her fifth wicket to have South Africa all out for 246 and deliver India its breakthrough triumph.

Opening batter Verma, who was only called back into the squad as injury cover for the finals, scored a career-best 87 off 78 balls as the tournament co-host reached 298-7 in 50 overs after losing the toss and being sent in to bat. South Africa was out for 246 in 45.3 overs in reply with its chase effectively over after skipper Laura Wolvaardt was out for 101. Spinner Sharma took the final wicket of the match and returned bowling figures of 5-39 from 9.3 overs. “We were waiting for this moment, and now this moment has come,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said, reflecting on a triumph after two previous finals defeats. “Now we want to make this a habit.” India was the last of the four teams to qualify for the semifinals, but then beat defending champion and seven-time winner Australia by five wickets to reach the final. South Africa beat four-time champion England by 125 runs to reach the final for the first time. Winning at home gave India its first major women’s cricket title.

My mind was clear.” Before her five-wicket haul, Sharma (58) posted her third half-century of the tournament to help India reached the second highest total in a World Cup final after Australia’s 356-5 against England in 2022.

Chasing a record 299, South Africa made a sedate start under immense pressure from medium pacer Renuka Singh. C.H.A.M.P.I.O.N.S. Wolvaardt shared a 51-run first-wicket stand before a direct throw from Amanjot Kaur ran out and Tazmin Brits for 23 in the 10th over. Anneke Bosche was bowled for a duck before Wolvaardt reached her half-century off 45 balls. She added 52 off 51 balls with Sune Luus, who scored 25. India lost its review in desperation to get Wolvaardt dismissed, and then gambled with Verma’s gentle off-breakers.

She sent back Luus with an easy return catch, and then had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind. Wolvaardt tried to keep the chase alive through partnerships with Sinalo Jafta (16) and Annerie Dercksen, who scored 35. In doing so, she reached a century off 96 balls. Sharma bowled Dercksen and then blunted South Africa’s chances when she Wolvaardt caught by Kaur in the 42nd over with the total at 220-7. Verma played a key role in setting the Proteas a challenging target after the final was delayed by two hours because of rain. She hit seven fours and two sixes and shared a 104-run opening stand with Smriti Mandhana (45). After Chloe Tryon dismissed Mandhana in the 18th over, Verma combined with Jemimah Rodrigues (24) to add a further 62 before both were out.

A fitting finale, especially if you are of an Indian persuasion, to what has been a historic and record-breaking tournament. South Africa, though, can also hold their heads very high. It does not happen very often that a team that gets bowled out for 69 and 97 in the same tournament, also buckles down to ultimately play the game that matters. It was not to be for them this time, but that side, with Wolvaardt as captain, and with several youngsters coming through, could be a tough nut to crack in upcoming tournaments. But such is sport that tonight will remain India's moment. And with Harmanpreet walking up to collect the prize that had previously eluded India, and had given such heartbreak to billions of Indian fans, it is tough to escape the supposition that India, having now taken that final step, may have just heralded the beginning of a new era, and one that may now be laden with even more trophies. We will, of course, be right with you every step of the way when the next bit of cricket rolls in, and there will be a lot of post-game literature coming from this one too - all of which can be read and enjoyed on ESPNcricinfo. But until next time, from Ashish, Raghav, Thilak and myself (Shashwat), it is goodbye. Take care, folks, and see you around soon! 12:54amAnd now Harmanpreet walks up to collect the trophy they have been longing for. And the rest of the team now joins in on the fun, and cue the fireworks. India, champions of the world, and India, champions of the world for the first time ever. And it front of their fans. Harmanpreet Kaur, India captain:I am so grateful for this crowd, they have been really amazing. Thank you for being with us in all our ups and downs. Last game also, we spoke that self-belief was there, even though we lost three back-to-back games. we knew we had something special to turn things around. They stayed positive, we knew what we had to do, everyone was so involved, they were there day and night and this team deserves to be there. (On Shafali bowling) When Laura and Sune were batting, they were looking really good. I just saw Shafali standing there, and the way she was batting, I knew it was our day. I thought I have to go with my gut feeling. If my heart was saying, I had to give her at least one over. And that was the turning point for us. When she came to the team, we spoke to her that we might need 2-3 overs, and she said if you give me bowling, I will bowl ten overs. Credit goes to her, she was so positive and she was there for the team. Salute her (for the way she was there for the team). (On the score) Today's pitch was totally different. We knew this total is enough for a final because you always have a little extra pressure. We should give credit to South Africa, they batted beautifully. In the end, they panicked a little and that is where we cashed (in). at the right time, Deepti came in and took those wickets. Every time, after every World Cup, we were always discussing to cross that line. In the last two years, Amol sir was with the team and he was always telling us to come up with something special, and to keep preparing for the big occasion. We should give credit to the support staff and the BCCI. We did not make too many changes (to our squad), and they really invested in us, and because of everyone, we are standing here. This is the start. We wanted to break this barrier. And our next plan is to make this a habit. We were waiting for it. now this moment has come. So many big occasions are coming, and we want to keep improving. This is not the end, just the beginning. And now, the moment Indian fans and this team has been waiting for. The players go up to collect their medals, starting with Charani, and there is a cheer as each player receives their medal. Laura Wolvaardt, South Africa captain:I could not be prouder of this team for the campaign we had. Brilliant cricket throughout but outplayed today (by India). Unfortunate to be on the losing side but we will definitely grow from this. (On coming back from 69 all out and 97 all out against Australia) We did so well to put those couple of bad games behind us. We were either really good or really bad, but thankfully more of the really good. Amazing tournament for a lot of the players, and proud of the resilience we showed. (Balancing batting and captaincy) Probably did not have my best year leading into the World Cup and did not start it well. Overthinking, it was not good. It is just another game of cricket, trying to separate the two and that sort of freed me up a bit to play my natural game and then focus on the captaincy at a different time. We were hoping for a little bit more (swing). There was still something in it, so still feel it was the right call to bowl. We were in it for a lot of the chase but lost ", "url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-women-s-world-cup-2025-26-1478193/india-women-vs-south-africa-women-final-1490443/live-cricket-score", "domain": "espncricinfo.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 8, "title": "HISTORY MADE!

After suffering heartbreak in the final of the 2005 and 2017 editions of the 50-overs showpiece, India beat South Africa by 52 runs to secure their first title in front of 40,000 delirious home fans at Navi Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium.

Congratulations to our players,” Prime Minister Modi said on social media. “This historic win will motivate future champions to take up sports.” The Indian cricket board announced the team would receive a reward of 510 million Indian rupees ($5.8m) for their title triumph, a victory which the Indian Express newspaper termed “Herstoric” on its front page. Harmanpreet said it could be a turning point for the women’s game in the cricket-mad country. Advertisement “We have been talking about this for many years – we’ve been playing good cricket, but we had to win one big tournament,” the batter said. “Without that, we couldn’t talk about change. At the end of the day, fans and the audience want to see their favourite team win. “It’s not that we weren’t playing good cricket, but we were waiting badly for this moment, and today we got a chance to live it.” The fairytale triumph of the Indian men’s team at the 1983 World Cup is considered the catalyst for the country’s rise to becoming a powerhouse of the game, both on and off the pitch, and batting great Sachin Tendulkar said Sunday’s win was “a defining moment in the journey of Indian women’s cricket”. “1983 inspired an entire generation to dream big and chase those dreams,” he wrote on social media. “Today, our women’s cricket team has done something truly special. They have inspired countless young girls across the country to pick up a bat and ball, take the field and believe that they too can lift that trophy one day …” Mithali Raj, who led India to the 2017 women’s final, said the victory for Harmanpreet’s side had made her dreams come true. “I’ve seen this dream for over two decades, to watch the Indian women lift that World Cup trophy,” she wrote on X. “Tonight, that dream finally came true. From the heartbreak of 2005 to the fight of 2017, every tear, every sacrifice, every young girl who picked up a bat believing we belong here, it all led to this moment.” A spectacular win by the Indian team in the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 Finals.

What if women ruled the world? Perhaps we caught a glimpse of it on the night India’s women lifted the World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. India had just beaten South Africa by 52 runs to claim their first-ever ICC Women’s ODI World Cup title. Fireworks split the sky, the tricolour rippled across the stands, and for once, a billion hearts exhaled in unison. Yet, amid the cheers and confetti, the night unfolded differently. It wasn’t just about victory. There was something softer in the air, a warmth, a sense of grace that transcended sport. Everything about the post-match ceremony began as expected. The captain hoisted the trophy. The players jumped, screamed, and waved to the crowd. But what followed transformed a sporting triumph into a moment of cultural grace. Instead of soaking in the spotlight, the players looked beyond themselves. They turned toward the women who had carried Indian cricket when nobody was watching Mithali Raj, Jhulan Goswami, Anjum Chopra, Reema Malhotra and called them onto the field. They didn’t just thank them with words; they shared the trophy, embraced them, and made them part of the moment they had made possible. Also read:Mamatha Maben hails India women winning cricket World Cup: 'There's no looking back' It wasn’t a planned tribute. It was spontaneous and pure. Mithali stood with the cup in her hands, smiling through tears. Jhulan, the tireless fast bowler from Chakdaha who once borrowed shoes to play, was speechless. For years, these women had fought for basic allowances, played on empty grounds, and endured a system that rarely saw them. That night, they weren’t forgotten footnotes, they were part of the story’s climax. For the current generation of Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, this victory wasn’t about personal glory. It was about continuity. They understood that their success stood on the shoulders of those who had played for nothing more than love for the sport. From the days when women cricketers travelled in unreserved compartments and paid for their own kits, to an era of packed stadiums and million-dollar leagues, the journey had been long, lonely, and often thankless. But this win was for everyone, for every young girl who had ever been told cricket wasn’t for her, for every mother who had fought to let her daughter play, and for those who stayed when there were no cameras, no sponsors, no applause. It was a homecoming. That was the beauty of it. The Indian girls didn’t just celebrate with their past, they reached out to their opponents too. Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues were seen hugging their South African counterparts in tears. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur personally invited Laura Wolvaardt’s team to join the celebration. Humble in victory and graceful in defeat, the oldest sporting motto, found its truest expression that night. As the Indian players celebrated their maiden World Cup title, heartbroken South African players struggled to hold back tears. Smriti, Jemimah, and Radha Yadav left their own celebrations to console the sobbing South African stars, including Marizanne Kapp, playing her fifth World Cup. The scene was a far cry from the aggression and performative emotion that often follow big matches in men’s cricket. There were no choreographed poses, no brand-driven theatrics, no chest-thumping. Just laughter, shared humanity, and an unspoken acknowledgment that sport, at its best, connects rather than divides. Also read:India bring back '83', this time with women power This isn’t about comparing men and women. It’s about the culture of leadership that women revealed that night, a leadership built on inclusion, not assertion. In an age when sporting triumphs are often choreographed for cameras, the Indian women reminded us that victory can be sincere, collective, and kind. Their gesture wasn’t about modesty, it was about maturity. They knew that this trophy belonged to more than the eleven who played that day. It belonged to every woman who had once picked up a bat in defiance of expectation. Ravi Ashwin later spoke about the moment on his YouTube channel. “They reminded us what sport is really about,” he said. “They remembered people when it mattered most.” He praised the women’s team for giving true credit to the previous generation, something, he noted, men often talk about but seldom live. By the time Mithali Raj held the trophy again, this time surrounded by the players who had grown up watching her, it was no longer just a symbol of victory.

A fitting finale, especially if you are of an Indian persuasion, to what has been a historic and record-breaking tournament. South Africa, though, can also hold their heads very high. It does not happen very often that a team that gets bowled out for 69 and 97 in the same tournament, also buckles down to ultimately play the game that matters. It was not to be for them this time, but that side, with Wolvaardt as captain, and with several youngsters coming through, could be a tough nut to crack in upcoming tournaments. But such is sport that tonight will remain India's moment. And with Harmanpreet walking up to collect the prize that had previously eluded India, and had given such heartbreak to billions of Indian fans, it is tough to escape the supposition that India, having now taken that final step, may have just heralded the beginning of a new era, and one that may now be laden with even more trophies. We will, of course, be right with you every step of the way when the next bit of cricket rolls in, and there will be a lot of post-game literature coming from this one too - all of which can be read and enjoyed on ESPNcricinfo. But until next time, from Ashish, Raghav, Thilak and myself (Shashwat), it is goodbye. Take care, folks, and see you around soon! 12:54amAnd now Harmanpreet walks up to collect the trophy they have been longing for. And the rest of the team now joins in on the fun, and cue the fireworks. India, champions of the world, and India, champions of the world for the first time ever. And it front of their fans. Harmanpreet Kaur, India captain:I am so grateful for this crowd, they have been really amazing. Thank you for being with us in all our ups and downs. Last game also, we spoke that self-belief was there, even though we lost three back-to-back games. we knew we had something special to turn things around. They stayed positive, we knew what we had to do, everyone was so involved, they were there day and night and this team deserves to be there. (On Shafali bowling) When Laura and Sune were batting, they were looking really good. I just saw Shafali standing there, and the way she was batting, I knew it was our day. I thought I have to go with my gut feeling. If my heart was saying, I had to give her at least one over. And that was the turning point for us. When she came to the team, we spoke to her that we might need 2-3 overs, and she said if you give me bowling, I will bowl ten overs. Credit goes to her, she was so positive and she was there for the team. Salute her (for the way she was there for the team). (On the score) Today's pitch was totally different. We knew this total is enough for a final because you always have a little extra pressure. We should give credit to South Africa, they batted beautifully. In the end, they panicked a little and that is where we cashed (in). at the right time, Deepti came in and took those wickets. Every time, after every World Cup, we were always discussing to cross that line. In the last two years, Amol sir was with the team and he was always telling us to come up with something special, and to keep preparing for the big occasion. We should give credit to the support staff and the BCCI. We did not make too many changes (to our squad), and they really invested in us, and because of everyone, we are standing here. This is the start. We wanted to break this barrier. And our next plan is to make this a habit. We were waiting for it. now this moment has come. So many big occasions are coming, and we want to keep improving. This is not the end, just the beginning. And now, the moment Indian fans and this team has been waiting for. The players go up to collect their medals, starting with Charani, and there is a cheer as each player receives their medal. Laura Wolvaardt, South Africa captain:I could not be prouder of this team for the campaign we had. Brilliant cricket throughout but outplayed today (by India). Unfortunate to be on the losing side but we will definitely grow from this. (On coming back from 69 all out and 97 all out against Australia) We did so well to put those couple of bad games behind us. We were either really good or really bad, but thankfully more of the really good. Amazing tournament for a lot of the players, and proud of the resilience we showed. (Balancing batting and captaincy) Probably did not have my best year leading into the World Cup and did not start it well. Overthinking, it was not good. It is just another game of cricket, trying to separate the two and that sort of freed me up a bit to play my natural game and then focus on the captaincy at a different time. We were hoping for a little bit more (swing). There was still something in it, so still feel it was the right call to bowl. We were in it for a lot of the chase but lost too many wickets. I kept checking that scoreboard and they were definitely tracking for 350. Back end (bowling) was amazing and we have been amazing throughout.

Shafali Verma played just two matches at the Cricket World Cup Image: Rafiq Maqbool/AP Photo/picture alliance Having been left out of the World Cup squad, Shafali was drafted in for the semi-final victory over Australia following an injury to Pratika Rawal and the opening batter imposed herself on the final with a 49-ball half century.

Sharma claimed 5-39, to go with her impressive 58 knock, in a fine all-round display on a memorable night for the hosts.

She reflected on the triumph after facing defeats in previous few tournaments. \"Now we want to make this a habit.\" Incidentally, India was the last of the four teams to qualify for the semifinals, but then beat defending champion and seven-time winner Australia by five wickets to reach the final. The win over Australia grabbed mass attention in India, where men's cricket has been center stage so far. \"Every World Cup we’ve gone into, there have been so many heartbreaks for all of us,\" a teary-eyed India opener Smriti Mandhana said. 45,000 spectators braved poor weather to cheer India to victory Image: Rafiq Maqbool/AP Photo/picture alliance \"We always believed that we had a bigger responsibility — not just to win, but to keep growing women’s cricket.

Written by Press Trust of India Published: Nov 03, 2025, 12:00 AM (IST) Edited: Nov 03, 2025, 12:22 AM (IST) India Win The Indian women’s cricket team kept its date with history by winning its first-ever World Cup with a 52-run victory over South to script a golden chapter in the country’s pantheon of sporting achievements here on Sunday. Shafali Verma, the 21-year-old, who till last week wasn’t even in the reserves, created memories of a lifetime by scoring 87 in India’s 298 for 7 and then grabbed a couple of crucial wickets to restrict the Proteas Women to 246 in in front of a packed DY Patil Stadium. The seasoned Deepti Sharma (5/39) and young Shree Charani (1/48) also did their bit under extreme pressure to usher in the most memorable day for women’s cricket in the country. If June 25, 1983 was a watershed moment for Indian men’s cricket, when Kapil’s Devils beat the mighty West Indies at the Lord’s, November 2, 2025 will be a seminal moment for women’s cricket movement. Rohit Sharma, who carries the scars of November 19, 2023, was watching the final from the stands with a prayer on his lips that Harmanpreet Kaur doesn’t meet his fate. For Harmanpreet, the lady who has done way more for Indian women’s cricket than anyone can envisage, knows how much it hurts to lose a final as it happened eight summers back and her girls didn’t let her down. As she latched on to Nadine de Klerk’s offering while back pedaling at extra cover, Ian Bishop fittingly called the moment “inspiring generations”. It couldn’t have been more poetic with AR Rahman’s rendition of ‘Vande Mataram’ reverberating across the stands. At the other end was the regal Laura Wolvaardt, who gave everything by scoring 101 off 98 balls. For head coach Amol Muzumdar, the ‘Nearly Man’ of Indian cricket, who couldn’t wear the whites that he richly deserved, the global triumph with the women’s national team would certainly heal those wounds that he has carried for years. This isn’t just another World Cup triumph but something whose social impact will only be understood may be two decades from now. TRENDING NOW Eleven special women, led by their firebrand skipper, from now on are not just role models but a beacon of hope for every girl from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, who aspire to pick up the willow and the white cherry, knowing that the sky is the limit.

India beat South Africa by 52 runs to clinch maiden title Saurav Goyal • India’s women’s cricket team has created history by lifting their first-ever ICC Women’s ODI World Cup trophy. In the final at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, the Women in Blue defeated South Africa by 52 runs to script a golden chapter in Indian cricket. Add The Sporting News as a preferred news source How did India’s innings unfold in the World Cup final? After a brief rain delay that pushed the start by nearly two hours, India got off to a flying start. Openers Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana set the tone early and took on the bowlers fearlessly. Shafali, recalled to the side for the knockout rounds, played the innings of her life, a brilliant 87 off 78 balls. Smriti supported her beautifully and scored 45 runs before falling to Chloe Tryon. Together, the duo stitched a crucial century stand that gave India the momentum they needed. Deepti Sharma then stepped up with a fluent 58 off 58 balls and kept the scoreboard ticking. Richa Ghosh’s late cameo, 34 runs from just 24 balls, helped India post an imposing total of 298 for 7 in their 50 overs.

Chasing 299 in a World Cup final was never going to be easy. South Africa’s openers, Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits, started steadily, adding valuable runs early on. But India struck quickly. Amanjot Kaur’s sharp throw caught Brits short of her crease, and that triggered a collapse. Anneke Bosch fell soon after, trapped in front by young Sree Charani. Harmanpreet Kaur’s captaincy brilliance came to the fore when she introduced part-timer Shafali Verma into the attack and the gamble worked instantly. Shafali dismissed both Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp, swinging the momentum completely in India’s favour. Despite Wolvaardt’s fighting effort, South Africa never quite recovered. In the end, South Africa were bowled out well short, handing India a historic 52-run victory.

The hosts had made the final after pulling off a seemingly improbable win against defending champions Australia. Having conceded 338 in the first innings, an unbeaten 127 from Jemimah Rodrigues and 89 from Harmanpreet Kaur saw India reach their target with nine balls to spare. It ended a run of 15 consecutive Australia wins in Women’s World Cups. Advertisement In Sunday’s final, India, put into bat by South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt, got off well thanks to a 104-run opening stand between Smriti Mandhana (45) and Shafali Verma, who top-scored with a 78-ball 87 to be named player of the match. South Africa fought back in the middle overs, but Sharma’s run-a-ball 58 and some power hitting from Richa Ghosh (34 off 24) lifted them to 298/7 in 50 overs. Ayabonga Khaka finished with 3/58 from her nine overs. In response, South Africa began slowly but picked up pace before Tazmin Brits was run out by an Amanjot Kaur direct hit. Anneke Bosch, who dropped two catches in the first innings, ended a nightmare performance by falling for a six-ball duck.

Indian skipper Harmanpreet turned to part-timer Verma, who, having shone with the bat, dismissed experienced duo Sune Luus (25) and Marizanne Kapp (four) to reduce South Africa to 123/4. Wolvaardt continued to hold her end up, scoring a century to become just the second player after Healy to score 100 runs in both the semi-final and final of a women’s World Cup after a match-winning 169 in the last-four clash against England. Annerie Dercksen stitched a 61-run stand with her after South Africa fell to 148/5, but was dismissed for 35 by Sharma, who won the player of the tournament award. Wolvaardt followed in Sharma’s next over, with Amanjot juggling a difficult chance twice at deep mid-wicket before clinging on with one hand. Sharma then dismissed Chloe Tyron and Nadine de Klerk, who led South Africa’s comeback win over India in the league phase, to complete her five-wicket haul (5/39), becoming the first player to score a half-century and take three or more wickets in a World Cup final. Ultimately, Ghosh’s hits in the final overs of the first innings, India’s chokehold in the middle overs while bowling, and some tremendous ground fielding and catching compared to South Africa’s errors on the field, resulted in a historic victory.

The showpiece event in front of a raucous, sold-out 45,000 crowd was delayed by two hours because of rain but no overs were lost and a match for the ages played out in Navi Mumbai. The hosts batted first and posted a competitive 298-7 - opener Shafali Verma led the charge with a dynamic 87 from 78 balls, backed up by Deepti Sharma's 58, which set the Proteas their record one-day international run-chase. Captain Laura Wolvaardt scored her second successive century, a flawless 101 from 98 balls, which kept South Africa in contention at 211-6 and needing 88 from the final 10 overs. But her dismissal, via a juggling catch from Amanjot Kaur at deep mid-wicket off Deepti in the 42nd over, sparked India's charge to victory and even with the game finishing after midnight local time, the packed crowd stayed and roared until the very last ball. The emotions were contrasting for South Africa, who finished 246 all out which confirmed their third successive final defeat, having lost the previous two T20 finals. Verma, who was only called up for the semi-finals after an injury to Pratika Rawal, added figures of 2-36 to her knock to also become an unlikely hero with the ball but it was Deepti, the tournament's leading wicket-taker, who ripped through the Proteas batters to finish with 5-39 as bedlam unfolded. It completes an incredible turnaround for India, who lost three consecutive group-stage games before their march to glory. The scenes at the DY Patil Stadium suggested this triumph will ignite a new era in the women's game.

For India in particular, though, with their cricket-loving nation and the domination of their men's side, it always felt like a matter of when and not if they would conquer the world. This was billed as the tournament that could change the world order of women's cricket and it had its obstacles - a slow start, one-sided games, washouts and crucially, India losing three games in a row to leave their semi-final place in some jeopardy. But it was that astonishing semi-final win against favourites Australia, at this same venue, which turned the tide and had crowds queuing outside the ground more than 24 hours out from the first ball, scrambling for tickets. The Women's Premier League, India's franchise T20 tournament, has been instrumental in improving their depth and giving them the experience of playing in front of big crowds, which had all built up to this moment. Australia have been the dominant force of women's cricket in the last decade, at times looking unstoppable, but this is likely to be a moment that is referred to in years to come as when the sport changed - just as it was when the men won their equivalent for the first time under Kapil Dev in 1983.

With rain washing out any hopes of starting on time, it was inevitable the captain who won the toss would bowl first but the Navi Mumbai surface remained batter-friendly as it had been in India's high-scoring semi-final against Australia, exemplified by Smriti Mandhana and Verma calmly cruising to 64-0 in the powerplay. It was actually South Africa's bowlers who appeared consumed by the occasion as they bowled too wide to the openers, who reeled off the boundaries with ease, before Mandhana was caught behind off Chloe Tryon and Verma chipped Ayabonga Khaka to mid-off.

Laura Wolvaardt struck a magnificent century, going back-to-back after her winning effort against England in the semi-final, but while she finished the tournament with 571 runs – the most by any woman in a World Cup – the ultimate prize belonged to India. India beat South Africa by 52 runs to win Women’s Cricket World Cup final – live reaction Read more They had two history-making heroes. The first was the unlikely figure of Shafali Verma, playing in this match only because of the ankle injury sustained by Pratika Rawal in the group stage but who chimed in with a career-best 87 from 78 balls and two wickets. Then, just as this final threatened to become a nailbiter, Deepti Sharma – who had contributed 58 runs – executed the perfect yorker to bowl Annerie Dercksen, and followed it up with the key scalp of Wolvaardt as Amanjot Kaur ran round from deep midwicket to take a diving juggle‑catch. For Amanjot it was third time lucky with the catch: for India, third time lucky in a World Cup final. “I am so grateful for this crowd – thank you for being there for us,” India’s captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, said, even as their booming cheers made it impossible for her to hear the post-match interview questions. “We lost three back-to-back games, but we knew this team had something special to turn things around.” The India head coach, Amol Mazumda, said: “They’ve done every Indian proud. It’s a watershed moment for Indian cricket.” For South Africa, the nightmare: after the T20 despair of 2023 and 2024, another World Cup slipping through their fingers. Shafali and Deepti contributed half-centuries, while Richa Ghosh struck 34 off 24 balls as India reached 298 for seven – and yet all had offered up chances. View image in fullscreen India recovered from losing three successive group-stage games to lift the trophy. Photograph: Punit Paranjpe/AFP/Getty Images Most egregious was the catch spilled at deep midwicket by Anneke Bosch, who grassed Shafali’s slog‑sweep at deep midwicket when the India opener was on 56. For the 21-year-old Shafali, this was the culmination of a surreal week: Tuesday, approved as an injury replacement for Pratika; Thursday, dismissed after five balls in the semi‑final; Sunday, hitting the winning knock in a World Cup final. Then there was her bowling, which took everyone by surprise – not least the South Africans. Before Sunday, Shafali had bowled just 14 overs in 30 one-day internationals. But in Navi Mumbai, in a World Cup final, her 15th and 16th proved to be deeply significant. First, Suné Luus pinged back a limp return catch. Then Marizanne Kapp poked at one down the leg side and was caught behind. Harmanpreet called Shafali’s spell the turning point: “I just saw Shafali standing there, and the way she batted today, I knew it was her day. I thought: ‘I have to go with my gut feeling. I’m going to give her one over.’ She was like: ‘I’m going to bowl 10 overs for the team.’ That shows how confident she was.” Play had been delayed for two hours by rain, leading South Africa to opt to bowl first in the hope of sticky, tricky batting conditions first up. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion A rollicking start from Shafali and Smriti Mandhana quickly put paid to that theory, the pair adding 104 inside 18 overs for the first wicket. The fact India failed to reach 300 after that platform speaks to the quality of South Africa’s bowling under pressure. Nonkululeko Mlaba conceded 47 in her 10 overs of left‑arm spin and bowled Harmanpreet after the India captain shaped to cut and missed. Ayabonga Khaka finished with three for 58, having India’s semi‑final hero Jemimah Rodrigues caught at extra-cover for 24 and returning at the death to have Richa caught.

Indian women's cricket finally touched its Everest as years of toil and near-misses culminated in an evening of redemption and history for the hosts. Rewarding the team, the BCCI also announced a gran cash reward of INR 51 crore for the team. ( India vs South Africa Women's Final Highlights ) India's breakthrough in the 13th edition of the global showpiece made them only the fourth team to win the trophy, joining Australia (7), England (4), and New Zealand (1) in the pantheon of champions. With the victory, Harmanpreet's team finally buried the ghosts of past heartbreaks - the 2005 and 2017 finals - and delivered India's much-awaited world title, a watershed moment for the game in the country. After posting 298 for 7 - the second-highest total in tournament history - India held their nerve to bundle out South Africa for 246 in 45.3 overs. The Proteas' charge revolved around captain Laura Wolvaardt's magnificent 98-ball 101, but the brilliance of Deepti Sharma (55 and 5/39) and Shafali Verma (87 and 2/36) ensured India's moment of destiny could not be denied. Deepti, Shafali script India's golden night Fittingly, India's triumph was shaped by two players with contrasting journeys. Deepti, the ever-reliable workhorse, finished as the tournament's highest wicket-taker (21) and bowled with guile and grace on the grandest stage. Shafali, on the other hand, was a story of second chances - drafted into the squad from outside the preferred group after Pratika Rawal's injury. Confined to domestic cricket with Haryana weeks ago, the 21-year-old dynamo returned to the world stage with an innings of audacity and maturity - 87 off 84 balls - before taking two crucial wickets to tilt the game decisively India's way. Her re-entry into the XI proved a masterstroke as she and Smriti Mandhana (45) gave India the perfect launchpad with a 104-run opening stand, forcing South Africa's bowlers into disarray after a two-hour rain delay. Mandhana's dismissal denied her a half-century, but it capped off a record-breaking campaign - 434 runs at 54.25, the most by any Indian batter in Women's World Cup history, including a century and two fifties. Star of India's semifinal win over mighty Australia, Jemimah Rodrigues appeared to be settling in for another long haul in the middle, but a superb low catch from skipper Laura Wolvaardt at cover off Khaka foiled her plans in the 30th over. With two set batters back in the dugout, India's hopes were pinned on skipper Harmanpreet for a defining innings, but that was not to be. Proteas resist, India stand tall South Africa began their reply briskly, with Tazmin Brits (23) and Wolvaardt adding 51 for the first wicket. But the breakthrough came via Amanjot Kaur's direct hit, and from there, India's bowlers tightened the noose. Shree Charani's immaculate lines on a placid surface fetched Anneke Bosch's wicket, before Shafali's double strike rattled the middle order. When Wolvaardt threatened to take the game away, Deepti struck twice in four balls - removing the Proteas skipper and Chloe Tryon (9) - to break the spine of the chase. She fittingly applied the finishing touch, dismissing Nadine de Klerk for her fifth wicket to spark celebrations of a lifetime.

( Getty Images: Alex Davidson ) Skip to timeline India has won its maiden ODI Women's World Cup, defeating South Africa by 52 runs in a pulsating epic in Navi Mumbai. Inspired by all-round performances from Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma, the tournament co-hosts overcame a sublime, fighting century from South African captain Laura Wolvaardt to claim victory in the first final to feature neither England nor Australia. Wolvaardt anchored the South African innings and the game was as good as won when she was dismissed in the 42nd over, caught deep in the outfield by a juggling Armanjot Kaur. Before that, India was put on its path to victory by 21-year-old Verma, who smashed an authoritative 87 and then claimed two wickets in consecutive overs. Wolvaardt was sublime in Navi Mumbai. ( Getty Images: Alex Davidson/ICC ) After rain had delayed the start of play by two hours, South Africa captain Wolvaardt won the toss and made the seemingly obvious decision to send India in. But the tournament co-hosts flew out of the blocks, with openers Smrti Mandhana and Verma combining for a domineering 104-run partnership. Star seamer Marizanne Kapp struggled to get any movement through the air or off the pitch, while up the other end, Ayabonga Khaka was expensive in the first ten overs. However, South Africa asserted itself in the contest with the introduction of pace bowling all-rounder Nadine De Klerk as well as spinners Nonkululeko Mlaba and Chloe Tryon. Tryon prised the Proteas' first wicked in the 18th over, when Smrti was caught behind for 45, before Khaka, much improved on her return to the attack, had Verma caught at mid-off for her outstanding 87. The heroes from Thursdays semifinal win over Australia, Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet Kaur, both made starts at No. 3 and 4, but were dismissed for 20 and 24 before Sharma anchored the back end of the innings with a run a ball 58. Hard-hitting wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh (34) smashed two massive sixes in a rearguard cameo as India finished its innings on 7-298. Rodrigues was dismissed cheaply in Navi Mumbai. ( Getty Images: Pankaj Nangia ) South Africa began its chase positively, with India requiring a moment of inspiration in the field to break Wolvaardt and Tasmin Brits's opening stand. Attempting an ill-advised single after striking the ball directly to mid-on, Brits (23) was well short of her ground as Amanjot Kaur threw down the stumps brilliantly. Anneke Bosch (0) came and went quickly before Sune Luus and the impregnable Wolvaardt combined for a steadying 52 run partnership. But the game turned when part-timer Verma was thrown the ball. Verma — who had an ODI bowling average of 76 before today -—had Luus (25) caught and bowled with her second delivery before strangling South African talisman Kapp (4) down the leg side in her next over. Down the other end, Wolvaardt was quietly making her way to a nerveless final century. She brought up the milestone in the 40th over, but didn't last long after that, holing out to Sharma in the 42nd, before De Klerk (18) was run out and Sharma claimed her fifth wicket to have South Africa all out for 246 and deliver India its breakthrough triumph.

India beat South Africa by 52 runs to win the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 final at the Dr. DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, claiming their first-ever World Cup crown. Deepti Sharma and Shafali Verma starred with both bat and ball to help India secure a tense win after South Africa had won the toss and elected to bowl. Chasing 299, South Africa looked well set at one stage to get to the target but Deepti Sharma’s breakthrough sparked a dramatic collapse. After she dismissed Annerie Dercksen, the Proteas crumbled from 209/5 to 246 all out. Captain Laura Wolvaardt (101) led from the front with a magnificent century but wickets fell regularly at the other end. Deepti was the standout performer with the ball, finishing with superb figures of 5/39 while Shafali Verma and Sree Charani chipped in with key wickets to seal a historic win for India. India clinch their maiden World Cup title | CWC25 Watch India's historic moment of winning their first ODI World Cup title as Harmanpreet Kaur holds onto the final catch. Deepti Sharma had turned the tide for India with a brilliant spell that yielded three crucial wickets, including that of South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt, who had kept her side in the hunt with a valiant century. But Deepti’s double strike in a single over that included the wickets of Wolvaardt and Chloe Tryon came at a decisive stage, just as the required run rate began to climb, leaving South Africa under mounting pressure. Laura Wolvaardt's valiant century | Player Highlights | CWC25 Watch South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt's highlights from her knock during the the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Final clash between India and South Africa. Earlier, Wolvaardt and Annerie Dercksen had offered resistance with a fifty-run stand, steering the Proteas past the 200-run mark after a mini collapse had left them reeling at 148/5. Deepti had earlier triggered that slide by dismissing Sinalo Jafta, following up on Shafali Verma’s impactful spell where she claimed two wickets in as many overs. Verma had shifted the momentum India’s way by striking twice in quick succession, first removing Sune Luus in her opening over following up with the prized wicket of Marizanne Kapp in her next over. That double blow tightened India’s grip on the contest before Jafta’s dismissal deepened South Africa’s troubles. Amanjot's juggling catch removes Wolvaardt | CWC25 Amanjot Kaur takes the all-important catch of Laura Wolvaardt as India pounce back into the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 Final. India’s first breakthrough came through sharp fielding when Tazmin Brits was run out by a direct hit from Amanjot Kaur at the non-striker’s end. Brits and Wolvaardt had given South Africa a solid foundation with a fifty-run opening stand in the powerplay, putting the pressure on India’s bowlers early in the chase. Sree Charani then struck in her first over to trap Anneke Bosch plumb in front. Despite the quick wickets, Wolvaardt continued to anchor the innings, guiding South Africa past 100 alongside Sune Luus. Sensing the need for a breakthrough, captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s decision to bring Verma into the attack proved game-changing. The opener’s twin strikes turned the momentum in India’s favour, setting the stage for Deepti Sharma’s match-defining spell that ultimately put India in control. Shafali Verma's twin strikes | CWC25 Watch Shafali Verma getting two wickets of as many overs during ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Final clash between India and South Africa. In the first innings, India put up 298/7 against South Africa, posting the second-highest score in a Women's ODI World Cup final. After a commanding 100-run opening stand, India were well placed at 223/3 but South Africa fought back to keep them below the 300 mark. Shafali Verma (87) led the way with a fine knock while Deepti Sharma (58) steadied the innings towards the end. Richa Ghosh (34) added a lively cameo that gave India late momentum. For South Africa, Ayabonga Khaka (3/58) was the standout performer with the ball while Nonkululeko Mlaba, Nadine de Klerk and Chloe Tryon picked up a wicket each.

A fitting finale, especially if you are of an Indian persuasion, to what has been a historic and record-breaking tournament. South Africa, though, can also hold their heads very high. It does not happen very often that a team that gets bowled out for 69 and 97 in the same tournament, also buckles down to ultimately play the game that matters. It was not to be for them this time, but that side, with Wolvaardt as captain, and with several youngsters coming through, could be a tough nut to crack in upcoming tournaments. But such is sport that tonight will remain India's moment. And with Harmanpreet walking up to collect the prize that had previously eluded India, and had given such heartbreak to billions of Indian fans, it is tough to escape the supposition that India, having now taken that final step, may have just heralded the beginning of a new era, and one that may now be laden with even more trophies. We will, of course, be right with you every step of the way when the next bit of cricket rolls in, and there will be a lot of post-game literature coming from this one too - all of which can be read and enjoyed on ESPNcricinfo. But until next time, from Ashish, Raghav, Thilak and myself (Shashwat), it is goodbye. Take care, folks, and see you around soon! 12:54amAnd now Harmanpreet walks up to collect the trophy they have been longing for. And the rest of the team now joins in on the fun, and cue the fireworks. India, champions of the world, and India, champions of the world for the first time ever. And it front of their fans. Harmanpreet Kaur, India captain:I am so grateful for this crowd, they have been really amazing. Thank you for being with us in all our ups and downs. Last game also, we spoke that self-belief was there, even though we lost three back-to-back games. we knew we had something special to turn things around. They stayed positive, we knew what we had to do, everyone was so involved, they were there day and night and this team deserves to be there. (On Shafali bowling) When Laura and Sune were batting, they were looking really good. I just saw Shafali standing there, and the way she was batting, I knew it was our day. I thought I have to go with my gut feeling. If my heart was saying, I had to give her at least one over. And that was the turning point for us. When she came to the team, we spoke to her that we might need 2-3 overs, and she said if you give me bowling, I will bowl ten overs. Credit goes to her, she was so positive and she was there for the team. Salute her (for the way she was there for the team). (On the score) Today's pitch was totally different. We knew this total is enough for a final because you always have a little extra pressure. We should give credit to South Africa, they batted beautifully. In the end, they panicked a little and that is where we cashed (in). at the right time, Deepti came in and took those wickets. Every time, after every World Cup, we were always discussing to cross that line. In the last two years, Amol sir was with the team and he was always telling us to come up with something special, and to keep preparing for the big occasion. We should give credit to the support staff and the BCCI. We did not make too many changes (to our squad), and they really invested in us, and because of everyone, we are standing here. This is the start. We wanted to break this barrier. And our next plan is to make this a habit. We were waiting for it. now this moment has come. So many big occasions are coming, and we want to keep improving. This is not the end, just the beginning. And now, the moment Indian fans and this team has been waiting for. The players go up to collect their medals, starting with Charani, and there is a cheer as each player receives their medal. Laura Wolvaardt, South Africa captain:I could not be prouder of this team for the campaign we had. Brilliant cricket throughout but outplayed today (by India). Unfortunate to be on the losing side but we will definitely grow from this. (On coming back from 69 all out and 97 all out against Australia) We did so well to put those couple of bad games behind us. We were either really good or really bad, but thankfully more of the really good. Amazing tournament for a lot of the players, and proud of the resilience we showed. (Balancing batting and captaincy) Probably did not have my best year leading into the World Cup and did not start it well. Overthinking, it was not good. It is just another game of cricket, trying to separate the two and that sort of freed me up a bit to play my natural game and then focus on the captaincy at a different time. We were hoping for a little bit more (swing). There was still something in it, so still feel it was the right call to bowl.

She sent back Luus with an easy return catch, and then had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind. Wolvaardt tried to keep the chase alive through partnerships with Sinalo Jafta (16) and Annerie Dercksen, who scored 35. In doing so, she reached a century off 96 balls.

The Women in Blue, after all, had endured multiple heart-breaks over the years, finishing runners-up in the ODI World Cup in 2005 and 2017 as well as in the 2020 T20 World Cup in addition to a plethora of semi-final defeats. Team India, however, finished on the right side of the result for once on Sunday as they posted a challenging 298/7 on the board after getting invited to bat by South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt before bundling the Proteas out for just 246 in reply. Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma played a starring role in the triumph with their all-round contributions, and would later be adjudged the Player of the Final and the Player of the Tournament respectively. Shafali, who was wasn’t even part of the squad for most of the tournament and was included as a last-minute replacement ahead of the knockouts after an injury to Pratika Rawal,top-scored for her side with a 78-ball 87, registering her highest ODI score in the process. Deepti later chipped in with a run-a-ball 58 while Smriti Mandhana (45) and Richa Ghosh (34 off 24) also made important contributions as the Women in Blue finished just shy of the 300-mark. South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt continued her fine run of form with a second century on the trot. After her brilliant 169 in the semi-final against England, Wolvaardt struck a 98-ball 101, breaking the record for the most runs in a single edition of a Women’s World Cup (571) in the process. Her knock, however, would ultimately go in vain as the South Africans – who were also yet to win a global title in women’s cricket and had made it to the final of an ODI World Cup for the first time ever – lost wickets in regular intervals and crumbled under pressure towards the end. All-rounder Annerie Dercksen was the only other batter to have gone past 30, chipping in with a lively 35, while Sune Luus (25) and Tazmin Brits (23) couldn’t convert their starts. Shafali and Deepti were once again the standout performers with the ball; while Deepti was the wrecker-in-chief with a haul of 5/22, which helped her finish as the tournament’s leading wicket-taker (22), Shafali struck twice in as many overs after getting introduced into the attack, getting rid of Luus and Marizanne Kapp. All-rounder Nadine de Klerk, who had starred in the Proteas’ thrilling three-wicket victory over the Women in Blue during their group-stage encounter in Visakhapatnam last month, was the last batter to depart after she chipped a full toss towards Harmanpreet at cover. The Indian captain, pedalling in the opposite direction, completed a fine catch to seal one of the most historic wins in Indian cricket history. Here’s how cricketers – both retired legends as well as current stars – reacted to the triumph: Champions of the World 💙🇮🇳I’ve seen this dream for over two decades, to watch the Indian women lift that World Cup trophy.Tonight, that dream finally came true.From the heartbreak of 2005 to the fight of 2017, every tear, every sacrifice, every young girl who picked up a…pic.twitter.com/MgClC7QE9J This was my dream, and you’ve made it come true 💙@TheShafaliVerma‘s 70 and two big wickets,@Deepti_Sharma06’s fifty and a fifer...absolute brilliance from both.

Ellison's wealth surged to $393bn (£290bn) on Wednesday morning, surpassing Musk's $385bn (£284bn), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The jump came after shares in Oracle, which make up a significant part of Ellison's fortune, soared more than 40%, boosted by the database software company's surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals. But the firm's share price had shed some of those gains by the end of the day, putting Musk back on top. Before briefly losing it to Ellison, Musk had held the title of world's richest person for nearly one year. He could receive a pay package worth over $1tn (£740bn) if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade, the board of the electric car firm has proposed. But shares in Musk's most valuable business, Tesla, have fallen this year. The electric vehicle maker has grappled with investor jitters over the Trump administration's rollback of electric vehicle initiatives, on top of consumer backlash to Musk's political involvement. Oracle has recently been propelled by growing demand for data centre infrastructure. The company projected as part of its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday that revenue from its cloud business will jump 77% this year, to $18bn, with further growth expected in the coming years. Oracle has reported a surge in demand among AI companies for its data centres, which helped push its stock dramatically higher. It signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with customers in the last quarter and anticipates several more deals in the months ahead, chief executive Safra Catz said on Tuesday. Trump ties and media ambitions Ellison, 81, helped start Oracle in 1977 and rose to prominence in the 1990s, when he became a public figure known as much for his lavish lifestyle as for the database company behind his fortune. He was Oracle's chief executive until 2014 and is now the company's chairman and chief technology officer. And he has positioned himself as an ally to President Trump. When Trump returned to the White House in January, Ellison appeared alongside OpenAI's Sam Altman and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son to announce a project called Stargate, to build out AI infrastructure in the US. Oracle has also emerged as a possible buyer of TikTok, the app owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance. TikTok is facing a ban in the US unless it divests itself of its ByteDance ownership. In January, when asked whether he was open to Musk buying TikTok, Trump responded: \"I'd like Larry to buy it, too.\" Ellison's media ambitions extend beyond TikTok. He funded the bulk of a $8bn bid by his son to acquire Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV. That deal between Paramount and the media company Skydance, which is controlled by his son David, closed last month.

But the ups and downs of tech stocks shuffled the ranks of others among the world’s top 10 richest, with Larry Ellison falling a notch while Bill Gates overtook the Google cofounders. Elon Musk holds his spot as the world’s richest person. Image: Getty Key Takeaways Elon Musk is the richest person in the world, a title he reclaimed in late May 2024. His fortune rose by $3 billion over the past month. Bernard Arnault remains the world’s No. 3 richest, unchanged from a month ago. He had been the world’s richest person from February through late May this year. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway ranks No. 6, up from No. 7 in early August. 9/10 of the richest people in the world are Americans, including Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison and Bill Gates. All of the top ten richest people as of September 1 are men, and each of them is worth $100 billion or more. For the second month in a row, gyrating tech stocks rearranged the ranking of more than half of the world’s ten richest people. As a result, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg swapped places with Larry Ellison to beome the world’s fourth richest person again, Warren Buffett moved ahead of Google cofounder Larry Page, and Bill Gates overtook both of the Google cofounders to become the world’s seventh richest person—up two spots in a month—as of the stroke of midnight on September 1. Elon Musk maintained his spot as the world’s richest person, worth an estimated $243.7 billion, $3 billion more than a month ago following an increase in the value of rocket firm SpaceX. Lately, Musk has been a vocal critic of a Brazilian Supreme Court judge over a ruling that froze bank accounts for his Starlink satellite internet business. Regulators in Brazil moved to shut down X on August 30 to comply with a Brazilian judge’s order. The biggest gainer in the past month was Zuckerberg. His fortune rose by nearly $14 billion to an estimated $180.5 billion as Meta Platforms’ shares climbed 9% during August. That gain moved him ahead of Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison to rank the Meta CEO as No. 4 richest in the world. He’s traded places with Ellison several times throughout the year so far. The biggest loser of this elite cohort in the past month was Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos. His fortune fell by $7.8 billion to $197 billion due to a drop in Amazon shares. Despite the decline, Bezos held onto his rank as No. 2 richest. But the gap between Musk and Bezos widened to nearly $47 billion on September 1, from just under $36 billion at the start of August. Gates’s move to No. 7 richest—up from No. 9 a month ag0—was partly due to a drop in the price of Google-parent Alphabet shares, which shaved a bit more than $6 billion off the fortunes of Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, now ranked No. 8 and 9, respectively Together the world’s top 10 richest are worth a combined $1.66 trillion—about $31 billion more than a month ago. Forbes has been keeping track of the world’s billionaires since 1987. In April we found 2,781 of them for our annual list. Here are the 10 richest people on Earth as of September 1, 2024 at 12 a.m. Eastern time, according to Forbes . Stock prices fluctuate routinely, so these net worths may change on a daily basis.

Elon Musk Net worth: $243.7 billion Source: Tesla, SpaceX, X (Twitter) Age: 53 Residence: Austin, Texas Citizenship: U.S. Musk is CEO of electric car company Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX; chairman and CTO of social media company X, formerly known as Twitter; and founder of artificial intelligence firm xAI. He owns 13% of Tesla stock and has pledged some of his stock as collateral for loans. The electric car maker’s shareholders voted in June in favor of Musk keeping nearly $50 billion of performance based stock options in what a Delaware judge had earlier called “the largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets,” when she voided the award this January. But the matter won’t be resolved anytime soon. A lengthy appeal of the Delaware ruling is likely to follow. Until Musk receives those options, Forbes will continue to discount the Tesla options from the pay package by 50%. In the meantime, Musk’s fortune rose by $3 billion in the past month, partly due to the increased value of his 42% stake in rocket firm SpaceX. Originally from South Africa, Musk moved to Canada before his 18th birthday, worked a variety of jobs, enrolled at Queen’s University in Ontario and then transferred to University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics.

[ 11 ] He stated his 2021 tax bill was estimated at $12 billion based on his sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock. [ 10 ] Musk has repeatedly described himself as \" cash poor \", [ 5 ] [ 6 ] and has \"professed to have little interest in the material trappings of wealth\". [ 5 ] In May 2020, he pledged to sell almost all physical possessions. [ 6 ] Musk has defended his wealth by saying he is accumulating resources for humanity's outward expansion to space . [ 12 ] At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion. [ 13 ] By the end of the year his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock. [ 14 ] During this period, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion on September 8, the largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index ' s history at the time.

In November 2021, Musk became the first person to have a net worth of more than $300 billion. [ 19 ] On December 30, 2022, due to declining stock values in Tesla, Musk had lost $200 billion from his net worth, the first person in history to do so, [ 20 ] [ 21 ] which was recognized by Guinness World Records in January 2023. [ 22 ] In December 2022, Bernard Arnault 's net worth surpassed Musk's, leading Musk to becoming the second wealthiest individual. Musk reclaimed the title in June 2023. [ 23 ] In January 2024, Musk became the second wealthiest person in the world after Bernard Arnault 's net worth overtook his, but Musk's net worth soon overtook Arnault's.

Firstly, Charlotte was the largest American city without a law school. Elon University has a thriving law program in Greensboro, NC and wanted to offer the same quality experience in Charlotte. The Elon Law Flex Program opened in Charlotte August 2023. The first cohort of students exceeded the initial enrollment goal. Applications for the second cohort are 30% higher than just one year ago. Secondly, Charlotte boasts a high concentration of sports teams (both professional and collegiate) and sports organizations. In September 2022, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Board of Directors announced that the conference office was moving its headquarters to Charlotte in 2023. Experiential opportunities like internships and undergraduate research are plentiful because of the existence of these sports teams and organizations. The Sport Management major continues to grow at Elon, but all students who are interested in sports from any major (business analytics, strategic communications, marketing, etc.) can participate in professional development opportunities. The abundance of these opportunities and connections to a strong professional network are not available to the same degree at the central campus. Similarly, banking and health care continue to grow in the metropolitan area. Charlotte is the number two banking city in the US. Our students and alumni have plentiful internship and career choices, respectively, as well as the opportunity to engage and network with top industry professionals. As more people move to Charlotte, there is more demand for quality health care. Currently, there is a lack of Physician Assistant (PA) programs in the area. To aid in this deficiency, Elon has proposed starting a PA program in January 2027. Charlotte also continues to grow each year. 157 people move to the Charlotte metro area each day. Charlotte is now the 14th-most populous city in the United States with a population of 917,000. If you include the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia metropolitan area, the population is 2.8 million people. Charlotte is also a top five destination where Elon undergraduate alumni move to after graduation. This presents a unique opportunity for continuing and professional education possibilities not only for Elon alumni, but for the entire Charlotte community. Lastly, equity was also a big reason why we choose Charlotte. Not all of our students can afford the global and domestic study away opportunities we offer in cities like Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington, DC. Charlotte is reasonably priced while still offering unique opportunities for all students of any major and interest. The Elon Charlotte Campus is located at 330 W. Tremont Ave, Charlotte, NC 28203. Graduate Academics Law Flex Program The Charlotte campus is offering a new, part-time Elon University School of Law J.D. program , which provides high-quality legal education in Charlotte. Elon Law is the only law school in Charlotte. The program builds on the success of its highly experiential, full-time curriculum in Greensboro, N.C., with the same distinguished faculty teaching in-person to meet the needs of aspiring attorneys in the Queen City seeking to study law with the flexibility of part-time program. The Elon University Charlotte law program began August 2024. Students in the part-time Flex Program have the opportunity to take many of the same elective courses offered in Greensboro (plus others tailored to the Charlotte market) and to participate in extracurricular and experiential opportunities such as clinics, law journals, and moot court programs. Physician Assistant Studies Program The Elon University Charlotte PA Program is a 24-month curriculum designed to integrate medical knowledge, clinical reasoning, and professional skill development. We prepare students to be compassionate physician assistant leaders who are committed to health equity and engaged in community. Graduates are equipped to work in one of the most in-demand professions in the nation. Learn more about the Elon Charlotte PA Program.

Nestled in a grove of oaks, Elon was founded as “a college for the world,” where students find their calling and reach their full potential within an environment of rich and meaningful relationships, and where they become big thinkers and creative problem solvers in every facet of their lives. Elon’s more than 7,000 undergraduate and graduate students learn through hands-on experiences and close working relationships with faculty and staff whose priorities are teaching and mentoring. The Elon curriculum is grounded in the traditional liberal arts and sciences with an emphasis on global experiences and career development. More than 70 undergraduate academic majors are complemented by professional and graduate programs in law, business, education and health care. Elon is ranked among the top national universities, with a No. 1 ranking in US News & World Report for excellence in undergraduate teaching for five consecutive years . The university’s academic divisions include Elon College, the College of Arts and Sciences; the Martha and Spencer Love School of Business; the School of Communications; the Dr. Jo Watts Williams School of Education; the School of Health Sciences; and the School of Law, which is located in Greensboro, N.C. Elon’s historic 690-acre campus in central North Carolina is designated as a botanical garden and includes the 56-acre Elon University Forest, a land preserve and natural area for scientific research, and Loy Farm, a center for environmental research and sustainability. Elon is a member of the Coastal Athletic Association. The Phoenix athletics program includes 17 intercollegiate men’s and women’s sports in NCAA Division I. Always evolving, Elon is an academic community that challenges, encourages and empowers our students to explore their passions, achieve their goals and change their communities for the better. The Elon Experiences As a pioneer and leader in engaged learning, Elon has refined a scholarly model that built upon collaboration, mentorship and innovation. Central to this model are five signature programs that comprise the Elon Experiences — study abroad, internships, undergraduate research, service and leadership. The Elon Experiences provide a natural extension to the work students do in the classroom and ensure that Elon graduates are prepared for both graduate school and careers. The five experiences are: Study Abroad . When students study abroad, their perspectives change forever. From studying in South Africa for a semester, to learning about business in Vietnam during Winter Term, to exploring liberal arts, music and performing arts in Italy during the summer, the 160+ international programs offered through the Isabella Cannon Global Education Center prepare students for a lifetime of global understanding and exploration. As part of its commitment to provide all students with an opportunity to study in other locations, Elon also has an extensive Study USA program that allows students to explore cultures, industries, geography and communities across the United States. Internships . Elon’s nationally recognized Student Professional Development Center counselors work with undergraduates from their first year to create personal development plans, résumés and strong networking skills. Through internships, students earn academic credit, gain firsthand knowledge of the workplace and obtain professional skills that put them ahead of other college graduates. Elon partners with an expansive network of employers across the country who actively recruit students for internships and full-time positions. Research . Working alongside faculty mentors, many Elon students undertake sophisticated research that is usually reserved for graduate students at other universities. This intensive undergraduate research experience challenges students to formulate complex questions, review the work of other scholars and conduct serious inquiry to uncover new knowledge and understanding. Elon students and faculty showcase their in-depth research across a broad range of disciplines annually at Elon’s Spring Undergraduate Research Forum, Summer Undergraduate Research Experience and at national research conferences and symposia. Leadership . At Elon, students work collaboratively within diverse communities, gaining the confidence and competence to put innovative ideas into action for positive change. Elon’s Center for Leadership offers initiatives to all students, such as the LeaderShop workshop series for individual leadership development and student organization development programs. The center helps students advance their leadership knowledge and skills and learn how social identities and lived experiences inform and shape their ideas around leadership.

The lavish property, previously owned by the late beauty mogul Sydell Miller, could cost Musk over $100 million, making it the most expensive real estate deal in West Palm Beach history. The Bristol Penthouse, an opulent design and white-glove amenity spread out over 19,000 square feet, is a favorite among billionaires and tycoons.

If Musk's rumored offer is accepted, it could shatter local real estate records. Miller’s family is reportedly considering Musk’s bid, according to Palmer Palm Beach. The Bristol is one of the best-equipped buildings in the world, boasting a spa for the crème de la crème. The apartment itself is \"fit for a king,\" with interiors by designer Peter Marino.

Pic: Reuters Why you can trust Sky News Elon Musk could be on track for a $1trn (£761bn) pay package - if Tesla meets a series of extremely ambitious targets over the next 10 years. The world's richest man has the potential to become a trillionaire after the controversial plans were approved by 75% of the company's shareholders. It would be the largest corporate pay package in history. However, it won't be easy. As part of the agreement, Musk will need to deliver 20 million Tesla vehicles over the next decade - more than double the number churned out over the past 12 years. He will be tasked with dramatically increasing the company's valuation and operating profits.

And even if Musk falls short of some of these targets, he could end up earning a lot of money.

Now is the moment Tesla wants to innovate, develop into robotics, self-driving and embrace the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). It's seeking a visionary leader to spearhead this move. And a lot of Tesla's market value is tied up in this ambition. Tesla's board of directors, who oversee the management of the business, are adamant that only Musk can make the lofty ambitions a reality. Some believe there's no one else like Musk. More shares in the company are \"critical to keep Musk at the helm to lead Tesla through the most critical time in the company's history\", said financial services firm Wedbush. \"We believe this was the smart move by the board to lay out these incentives/pay package at this key time as the biggest asset for Tesla is Musk ... and with the AI revolution, this is a crucial time for Tesla ahead with autonomous and robotics front and centre.\" Read more money news: Bank of England holds interest rate M&S reveals cost of cyber attack Subscribe to our Money newsletter First name Last name Email Opposition Not everyone is in favour of the pay package. Major investor advice firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) warned the 10-year pay agreement reduces the board's ability \"to meaningfully adjust future pay levels in the event of unforeseen events or changes in either the performance or strategic focus of the company over the next decade\". In a note, ISS said: \" The high value of each tranche could also potentially undermine Musk's desire to achieve all goals and create significant value for shareholders\", and that the goals \"lack precision\". Musk has described ISS and another major adviser, Glass Lewis, as \"corporate terrorists\" . There was speculation he would walk away from the business if the package was not agreed on.

[ 4 ] As of May 2025, he is the richest person in Asia and the 13th richest in the world , with a net worth of US$108 billion. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Sometimes characterized as a plutocrat , [ 7 ] Ambani has attracted both fame and criticism for reports of market manipulation, political corruption, cronyism, and exploitation. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Early life Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden (present-day Yemen ) into a Gujarati Hindu family to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. His father was the founder and CEO of Reliance Industries, currently the largest public company in India by market capitalization. [ 12 ] He has a younger brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaonkar. [ 13 ] Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his father decided to move back to India in 1958 to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles. [ 14 ] The latter was originally named \"Vimal\" but later changed to \"Only Vimal\". [ 15 ] [ 16 ] His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar , Mumbai, until the 1970s. [ 17 ] The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society , used public transportation , and never received an allowance. [ 18 ] Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in Colaba , where Ambani and his brother lived with their families on different floors. [ 19 ] Education Ambani did his primary schooling from the Scindia School , Fort, Gwalior [ 20 ] and senior secondary schooling from Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road , Mumbai , along with his brother and Anand Jain , who later became his close associate. [ 21 ] After his secondary schooling, he studied at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai . [ 22 ] He then received a BE degree in chemical engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University (where Steve Ballmer was his classmate [ 25 ] ) but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise. [ 23 ] His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company. [ 18 ] Ambani was influenced by his teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma because they are \"the kind of professors who made you think out of the box.\" [ 23 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Career Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (later Reliance Communications Limited ), which was focused on information and communications technology initiatives. [ 28 ] At the age of 24, Ambani was given charge of the construction of Patalganga petrochemical plant when the company was heavily investing in oil refinery and petrochemicals. [ 29 ] Ambani directed and led the creation of the world's largest grassroots petroleum refinery in Jamnagar , India, which could produce 660,000 barrels per day (33 million tonnes per year) in 2010, integrated with petrochemicals, power generation, port, and related infrastructure. [ 30 ] In December 2013, Ambani announced the possibility of a \"collaborative venture\" with Bharti Airtel in setting up digital infrastructure for the 4G network in India. [ 31 ] On 18 June 2014, Ambani said he will invest Rs 1.8 trillion ( short scale ) across businesses in the next three years and launch 4G broadband services in 2015.

[ 33 ] Ambani was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2016 for engineering and business leadership in oil refineries, petrochemical products, and related industries.

He is considered to be one of the most popular and acclaimed playback singers of the Hindi film industry . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Among the numerous nominations and awards he won, his song \"Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai\" from the film Rajnigandha (1973) won him the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer . Mukesh was also popular as being the voice of actors Raj Kapoor , Manoj Kumar , Feroz Khan , Sunil Dutt and Dilip Kumar . [ 4 ] Early life [ edit ] Mukesh was born in Delhi in a Mathur Kayastha family on 22 July 1923. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] His parents were Zorawar Chand Mathur, an engineer, and Chandrani Mathur. He was the sixth in a family of ten children. The music teacher who came home to teach Mukesh's sister, Sundar Pyari, found a pupil in Mukesh, who would listen from the adjoining room. Mukesh left school after the 10th grade and worked briefly for the Department of Public Works . He experimented with voice recordings during his employment in Delhi and gradually developed his singing abilities and also his musical instrumental skills. [ 8 ] Singing career [ edit ] Mukesh's voice was first noticed by Motilal , a distant relative, when he sang at his sister's wedding. Motilal took him to Bombay (now Mumbai) and arranged for singing lessons by Pandit Jagannath Prasad. During this period Mukesh was offered a role as an actor-singer in a Hindi film, Nirdosh (1941). His first song was \"Dil Hi Bujha Hua Ho To\" as an actor-singer for Nirdosh written by Neelkanth Tiwari. His first hit song as a playback singer was \"Dil Jalta Hai To Jalne De\" for actor Motilal in 1945 with the film Pehli Nazar with music composed by Anil Biswas and lyrics written by Aah Sitapuri. Mukesh was such a fan of singer K. L. Saigal that in his early years of playback singing he used to imitate his idol. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In fact, it is said that when K. L. Saigal first heard the song \"Dil Jalta Hai...\", he remarked, \"That's strange, I don't recall singing that song\". [ 9 ] Mukesh created his own singing style with the help of music director Naushad Ali , who helped Mukesh to come out of his Saigal style and create his own style. Naushad gave him songs for the film Andaz . Initially Mukesh was the ghost voice of Dilip Kumar in this movie and Mohammed Rafi sang for Raj Kapoor . He delivered many Hits for Naushad in films like: Anokhi Ada (1948), Mela (1948), Andaz (1949). Other composers who used Mukesh voice for great Dilip Kumar in hit songs like \"Jeevan Sapna toot gaya\" were Anil Biswas in Anokha Pyar, Ye Mera Diwanapan hai, Shankar–Jaikishan in Yahudi and Suhana Safar and Dil Tadap Tadap ke, Salil Choudhary in Madhumati. However, later Dilip Kumar choose Rafi as his ghost voice and Mukesh became the ghost voice of Raj Kapoor. Mukesh recorded highest number of songs for Shankar–Jaikishan, that is 133 songs followed by Kalyanji Anandji ie 99 songs. Out of 4 Filmfare Awards , Mukesh won 3 awards for Shankar–Jaikishan songs. In 1974, Mukesh received National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song \"Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai\" from Rajnigandha (1974), and Filmfare Awards for the songs \"Sab Kuch Seekha Humne\" in the movie Anari (1959), \"Sabse Bada Naadan Wahi Hai\" in Pehchaan (1970), \"Jai Bolo Beimaan Ki\" in Beimaan (1972) (all the three songs composed by Shankar–Jaikishan) and \" Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein \", the title song of film Kabhie Kabhie (1976) (composed by Khayyam ). A total of around 1,300 songs were sung by him. This number is less than those sung by some of his contemporaries, but the fact is that Mukesh emphasised on quality rather than quantity. The comparatively fewer songs sung by him in the 1970s can be attributed to his failing health due to his worsening heart problem . [ citation needed ] Mukesh sang many songs for Kalyanji Anandji music director duo. Mukesh sang more songs with the K-A duo after Shankar–Jaikishan. From \"Naina hai jadoo bhare...\" Bedard Zamana Kya Jane (1958) composed by Kalyanji alone as Kalyanji Virji Shah, and \"Main hoon mast madari...\" Madari (1959) as the first Kalyanji-Anandji-Mukesh combo, to \"Chahe aaj mujhe napasand karo\" Darinda 1977, the K-A, Mukesh combination gave numerous popular songs like \"Chhalia mera naam...\", \"Mere toote hue dil se...\", \"Dum dum diga diga\" Chalia (1960), \"Muj", "url": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_(singer)", "domain": "en.m.wikipedia.org", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 4, "title": "Mukesh (actor ) - Wikipedia", "snippet": "Mukesh Madhavan (born Mukesh Babu; 5 March 1957), known mononymously as Mukesh, is an Indian actor, film producer, television presenter, and politician who predominantly works in …", "full_content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Indian actor and politician This article may contain bundled citations with poor text–source integrity .

His Reliance Industries is a conglomerate reporting over $100bn in annual revenue, with interests that include petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecoms and retail.", "full_content": "The youngest son of Mukesh Ambani , Asia’s richest man, married his longtime girlfriend early Saturday in what many dubbed the “wedding of the year”, attended by global celebrities, business tycoons and politicians, and highlighting the billionaire’s staggering wealth and rising clout. The wedding rituals, including an exchanging of garlands by the couple as they walked around a sacred fire, began on Friday and were completed past midnight. The celebrations of Anant Ambani marrying Radhika Merchant took place at the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai and the family home. The marriage was the culmination of months of wedding events that featured performances by pop stars including Rihanna and Justin Bieber. The four-day wedding celebrations, which began with the traditional Hindu wedding ceremony, will be followed by a grand reception that will run through the weekend. The guest list includes former British prime ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson, David Beckham, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin H Nasser, and pop stars Adele, Lana Del Rey and Drake, according to local media. The Ambani family did not confirm the guest list. Television news channels showed celebrities such as Kim Kardashian in a red ensemble, and professional wrestler and Hollywood actor John Cena arriving. International guests also wore traditional dresses by major Indian fashion designers. They put on embroidered “sherwanis”, a long-sleeved outer coat worn by men in South Asia . Cena came in sky blue sherwani and white pants, while singer Nick Jonas wore a pink sherwani and white trousers. Police imposed traffic diversions around the wedding venue from Friday to Monday to handle the influx of guests who flew to Mumbai, where heavy monsoon rains have caused flooding and flight disruptions for the past week. The extravaganza and the display of opulence that has come with the wedding has led many to raise questions about rising inequality in India, where the gap between rich and poor is growing. The event has also sparked anger among some Mumbai residents, who say they are struggling with snarled traffic. “It affects our earnings. I don’t care much about the wedding,” said Vikram, a taxi driver who uses only his first name. Mukesh Ambani is the world’s ninth-richest man, with a net worth of $116bn (£91bn), according to Forbes. His Reliance Industries is a conglomerate reporting over $100bn in annual revenue, with interests that include petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecoms and retail. The Ambani family owns, among other assets, a 27-storey family compound in Mumbai worth $1bn. The building contains three helipads, a 160-car garage and a private movie theatre. Anant, 29, oversees the conglomerate’s renewable and green energy expansion. He also runs a 3,000-acre animal rescue centre in Gujarat state’s Jamnagar, the family’s hometown. Radhika, also 29, is the daughter of pharmaceutical tycoon Viren Merchant and is the marketing director for his company, Encore Healthcare, according to Vogue . Ambani’s critics say his company has relied on political connections during Congress party-led governments in the 1970s and 80s, and under prime minister Narendra Modi’s rule after 2014. The Ambani family’s pre-wedding celebrations have been lavish and star-studded. In March, they threw a three-day prenuptial bash for Anant that had 1,200 guests, including former world leaders, tech tycoons and Bollywood megastars, and performances by Rihanna, Akon and Diljit Dosanjh, a Punjabi singer who shot to international fame when he performed at Coachella. The event was also attended by tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It was the start of lavish months-long celebrations that have grabbed headlines and set off a social media frenzy. In May, the family took guests on a three-day cruise from Italy to France, which included Katy Perry singing her hit song “Firework” and a performance by Pitbull, according to media reports. The family also organised a mass wedding for more than 50 underprivileged couples on 2 July as part of the celebrations.

He is completed his graduation in chemical engineering from Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, initially pursued higher studies abroad. He earned his MBA from Stanford University. The Beginning Of Reliance Industries In the year 1980, we saw a remarkable move by India – thanks to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who spearheaded the Polyester Fiber Yarn (PFY) project. This move signaled a key shift forward in the Indian industrial scene. Amid intense competition, Dhirubhai Ambani’s Reliance Industries, emerged triumphant by securing a vital license to participate in this initiative. Dhirubhai Ambani, father of Mukesh Ambani, ensured Reliance was part of this historical transformation. The Turning Point Mukesh Ambani’s Life Recognising the potential in the PFY industry, Dhirubhai called upon Mukesh Ambani to leave Stanford and instead, play his part in the family business. Consequently, Mukesh, in 1981, opted to leave his ongoing MBA program to take the lead in the establishment of the first-ever PFY production facility for Reliance in India.

Dating back to the late 90s, Mukesh pulled off this considerable project by pouring in roughly Rs 100,000 crore, proving once again why Reliance Industries is a formidable player in the arena of petrochemicals and refining.

However, his position was unique - while Rafi was perfection incarnate and Kumar was the astonishing yodeller, Mukesh was that man in a bar who would pour you a drink and would sing you a song for friendships' sake. His voice held a haunting, melancholic quality that could reach into your soul and move you to tears. He was born Mukesh Chand Mathur on 22 July 1923, into a small middle-class family living in Delhi. He was first heard noticed by an actor and distant relative, Motilal, when he sang a song at his sister's wedding. Deeply impressed, Motilal brought him to his own house in Bombay and had him groomed by the noted singer Pandit Jaganath Prasad. During this time Mukesh tried his hand at acting, but his first acting film, Nirdosh (1942) , was a flop. However, he got his big break as a singer with Pahali Nazar (1945) - picturised on Motilal, the song became a success. Initially, his voice did seem to be imitating K.L. Saigal, but he acquired his own style in Gesture (1949) . The film, a passionate love triangle, became a runaway hit and so did all of its songs, especially the Mukesh solos. As well as launching Mukesh's career, it created an association with the renowned Raj Kapoor that would last throughout their lives. Starting with Aag (1948) all the way through to Dharam Karam (1975) , Mukesh sang for Raj Kapoor and together they produced some of the greatest film songs in Bollywood history, most notably in Awaara (1951) , Shree 420 (1955) , _Anadi (1959)_, _Sangam (1964)_ and Mera Naam Joker (1970) . Life was not always that good, however. Encouraged by his success as a singer, he made a few more attempts to make it as an star, and acted in two films - Mashooka (1953) and Anuraag (1956) . They sadly sank at the box-office. To make matters worse, when he returned to singing he found that offers had dried up, and his financial affairs became that, unable to afford their school fees, his two children were thrown out of school! Fortunately, he came back with a bang in Yahudi (1958) , and two other hits from 1958 - Madhumati (1958) and Parvarish (1958) - put him back on top as a singer to be reckoned with. Even Sachin Dev Burman, who had not used him for a decade, composed two classic songs for him from the films _Bambai ka Babu (1960)_ and Bandini (1963) . He flourished throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with soulful hit songs, most notably from Anand (1971) , a classic about a dying man; Rajnigandha (1974) , a middle-class love story; and Kabhie Kabhie (1976) , a cross-generation romance. In 27 August 1976, while on a concert tour in the USA, Mukesh suffered a sudden, sharp and fatal heart attack in Detroit. Afterwards, several recorded songs of his came out in films released after his death, the last being for Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978) , a Raj Kapoor film. He left behind a void that many male singers, including his own son Nitin Mukesh, have tried to fill, but no one has managed to fill the place of such a great singer. Mukesh was, is and will be the only Bollywood singer to possess a golden voice... - IMDb mini biography by: Q.

Over a career spanning more than three decades, Mukesh became one of the leading playback singers of Bollywood, widely recognized for his melancholic and soulful voice. He began his musical journey under the influence of K. L. Saigal, who was his ideal and source of inspiration. Despite a few initial struggles and setbacks, Mukesh’s undeniable talent and distinctive voice soon catapulted him to fame. His first major breakthrough came with the song “Dil Jalta Hai To Jalne De” from the 1945 film Pehli Nazar . This song marked him as a unique voice in the industry, different from the then-dominant style of playback singing. Critics and audiences alike praised Mukesh for his ability to convey profound emotions through his singing, which resonated deeply with listeners. His rise to stardom was further solidified with hits like “Awara Hoon” from the film Awaara (1951) and “Yeh Mera Deewanapan Hai” from Yahudi (1958). Mukesh’s impact on Indian cinema is evident in the sheer timelessness of his songs. His collaboration with legendary composers such as Shankar-Jaikishan, Naushad, and Salil Chowdhury yielded timeless classics that continue to be celebrated. He lent his voice to many iconic actors, most notably, Raj Kapoor, with whom he shared a particularly fruitful artistic relationship. Mukesh’s ability to infuse genuine emotion into his performances made his songs an integral part of these films and contributed significantly to their success. Throughout his career, Mukesh received numerous accolades, including several Filmfare Awards, which testified to his immense talent and enduring legacy. Even after his demise in 1976, his music remains a cornerstone of Bollywood’s musical heritage, influencing generations of singers and music lovers alike. Early Life and Musical Beginnings Mukesh Chand Mathur, known to the world simply as Mukesh, was born on July 22, 1923, in Delhi, India. Growing up in a middle-class family, Mukesh’s early years were marked by cultural richness and an inherent love for music, elements that would play pivotal roles in shaping his future career. His family’s modest lifestyle did not afford many luxuries, but it did provide an environment where the arts were greatly appreciated. Mukesh’s father, Zorawar Chand Mathur, worked as an engineer, while his mother, Chandrani Mathur, nurtured the household with traditional values. Despite no professional musical training in the family, Mukesh found inspiration from early exposure to regional and classical Indian music. His passion for singing was evident even as a child, as he often took part in community gatherings and school competitions, where his voice began to attract notice. The formative years were not without challenges. Initial efforts to break into the music industry were met with obstacles, exacerbated by the lack of a structured path to becoming a playback singer at the time. However, Mukesh’s perseverance was undeterred. It was at a family wedding where he first drew the attention of the renowned actor and producer Motilal, a distant relative. Recognizing his nephew’s potential, Motilal took Mukesh under his wing, becoming an influential mentor in his nascent career. Through Motilal’s guidance and connections, Mukesh moved to Mumbai, where he began to train rigorously, refining his vocal skills. It was during this period that he secured his first opportunity to sing in a film. His debut song “Dil Hi Bujha Hua Ho To” in the movie Nirdosh (1941) was a modest success, but it marked the beginning of a storied career. Subsequent collaboration with the iconic composer Naushad further elevated Mukesh’s standing, as they worked together on several landmark projects. These early experiences laid the foundation for Mukesh’s unique singing style, characterized by a deep resonance and emotive quality that would come to define his contributions to Bollywood music. It was the beginning of a journey that would see Mukesh rise to become one of the most revered playback singers in Indian cinema. The Unmistakable Voice of Sadness and Romance Mukesh’s voice has long been synonymous with melancholy and romance in Bollywood’s golden era. His unique vocal qualities set him apart, making him the go-to singer for songs that needed a touch of emotional depth and poignancy. Mukesh possessed an innate ability to convey deep emotions, delivering each note with an authenticity that resonated profoundly with listeners. Unlike his contemporaries, such as Kishore Kumar, whose versatility allowed him to excel in a variety of genres, or Mohammad Rafi, who was celebrated for his vocal range and technical prowess, Mukesh excelled in imparting a touching sense of wistfulness and sorrow. One of the key factors that contributed to Mukesh’s enduring appeal was his ability to maintain a sense of simplicity and sincerity in his singing.

Read the biography and life history of Mukesh.", "full_content": "Mukesh was nicknamed as The Man with the Golden Voice and his songs are true examples of his inimitable voice. Mukesh was born as Zoraver Chand Mathur in Delhi on July 22nd, 1923. His name is mentioned with the names of great legends like Mohammed Rafi and Kishore Kumar. Mukesh left studies after the 10th standard and got a job with Delhi Department of Public Works. He experimented with voice recordings and at the same time, honed his singing ability. A short biography covering the life history of Mukesh has been given below. The singer in Mukesh was recognized by the renowned actor Motilal, who happened to be a distant relative of Mukesh. He saw Mukesh perform at the wedding of his sister and recognized a hidden spark in the young boy. Mukesh was taken to Bombay where he received training in music to refine his voice. In this period he even managed to bag a role in a Hindi movie titled Nirdosh (1941), which unfortunately did not fare well at the box office. His first stint as a playback singer was in the movie Pehli Nazar (1945). The song incidentally was picturized on Motilal. Mukesh had the voice that could paint a thousand shades of melancholy. The way he sang, with the perfect tone and diction, he was considered as second to none. The pain that he had in his voice could not be imitated by anyone else. One could feel the tenderness and joy with doses of hidden anguish in his voice that was presented in a raw manner. He went on to command a huge fan following and was counted as a legend among legends. The music maestro Salil Choudhury praised Mukesh with following quote: \"Each word from his lips was a pearl. No one could sing the way Mukesh did, with the right diction, inflexion and intonation. His vocal timbre was out of this world.\" Mukesh finally discovered his own style with the films Mela (1948) and Andaaz (1949). With music director Naushad, Mukesh belted out some unforgettable hits like Tu Kahe Agar, Jhoom Jhoom ke Naacho Aaj, Hum Aaj Kahin Dil Kho Baithe, Toote Na Dil Toote Na. These four solos made him a well-known playback singer overnight. It was in the year 1948 that Mukesh sang for Raj Kapoor for the movie Aag. The voice of Mukesh perfectly matched the helplessness that was portrayed onscreen by Raj Kapoor in the song Zinda Hoon Is Tarah. After that there was no looking back and this wonderful partnership went on till the year 1975. With Raj Kapoor, Mukesh immortalized heartbreaks and despair and belted out some classic numbers and endless list of hits. The ones that deserve a mention are Awaara (1951), Shri 420 (1955), Parvarish (1958), Anari (1959), Sangam (1964), Mera Naam Joker (1970) and Kabhi Kabhi (1976). His last recording with Raj Kapoor was the song \"Ek Din Bik Jaayega\" from the movie Dharam Karam. The music was composed by R.D. Burman. Mukesh breathed his last while on a concert tour to Detroit, U.S. He suffered a massive heart attack. His untimely death shocked the entire nation and the film industry. When the news of his death reached the film industry, Raj Kapoor said, \"I have lost my voice\". Such was the fame of Mukesh who shall truly remain a legend. There was and will be none who could produce the same kind of magic he did.", "url": "https://culturalindia.net/indian-music/indian-singers/mukesh.html", "domain": "culturalindia.net", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3214}, {"source_number": 13, "title": "Mukesh Biography: The Golden Voice Of Bollywood", "snippet": "Aug 7, 2024 · Dive into the life of Mukesh Chand Mathur, Bollywood's Golden Voice, and discover his timeless songs that continue to enchant millions.", "full_content": "In the rich tapestry of Indian cinema, few voices have been as influential and soul-stirring as that of Mukesh Chand Mathur, known mononymously as Mukesh.

Just as Gautam Gambhir prepares to begin his stint as the head coach of the Indian men's national team, Manjrekar suggested that there's no 'direct correlation' between coaches and the team winning the World Cup. Manjrekar, instead, suggested that it's all about Indian cricket and the way it is functioning that suggests how successful a team is or isn't. India first won the ODI World Cup in 1983 when the team didn't really have a designated head coach. Then came an incredibly successful stint in 2007, and 2011 where MS Dhoni led the team, though the coaches were different on both occasions. Under Dravid's mentorship, India lifted the T20 World Cup 2024 title in Barbados and ended their 11-year-long ICC title drought. India also came close on two occasions previously when they lost in the World Test Championship final and ODI World Cup final against Australia last year. As Gambhir looks to prepare a team that could challenge other top sides in the world at the ICC Champions Trophy (2025), ICC World Test Championship final (2025) and the 2027 ODI World Cup, Manjrekar wants focus on the players and not the coach. \"No coach, Lalchand Rajput, Gary Kirsten & Dravid. Coaches when India won WCs in 1983, 2007, 2011 & 2023. It's really about Indian cricket, not who the coach is. Time we stop thinking there is a direct correlation,\" Manjrekar wrote on X.

Through his …", "full_content": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta is dedicated to telling evidence-based stories across different media formats. Robin L Marshall for Getty Images By Kendra Barnett Sanjay Gupta, CNN’s chief medical correspondent, is not your average journalist. He’s also a brain surgeon, a professor of neurosurgery, and a former White House fellow. Through his deep expertise and a commitment to concise, digestible storytelling, Gupta is demonstrating how to cut through the 24/7 news cycle and build meaningful connections with audiences. Onstage at ADWEEK’s annual Brandweek event in Atlanta Wednesday, the doctor-turned-reporter opened up about his career path, his experience reporting from disaster-torn locales around the world, and how he maintains trust and accuracy across different mediums. “[I try] to make sure that there’s plenty of good information out there,” he said. “So even if people aren’t seeking [CNN] out, if they go seek out a topic, in addition to information that may be mis- or disinformation—which is plentiful out there—there is a source of truth and accuracy and evidence-based journalism. That’s what I try and do.” Much of Gupta’s work has explored the medical and health impacts of natural disasters and war. More than once, he’s had to act in a surgical capacity rather than an editorial one. In 2003, Gupta was reporting in war-ravaged Iraq, embedded within a Navy medical unit, when a U.S. Marine Sergeant suffered a gunshot wound to the head. He was rushed to the medical corpsmen serving in 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, where troops asked Gupta to intervene as a neurosurgeon. “We didn’t have the tools to do the operation I needed to do, which was to remove part of his bone,” he recalled. “So I took the drill, which was a Black & Decker drill, and I sterilized the bit, and I used that to basically remove the outer portion of his bone, decompress his brain, remove the bullet and bone fragments, and all this stuff. I wrapped him up. Black Hawk helicopter lands, he takes off, and I never know if I’m going to see him again.” He did indeed see the Marine Sergeant, Jesus Vindaña, again, and even met his family, an incident he recalled in a 2007 story for CNN. “It was a real blending of my worlds,” Gupta said. Throughout his career as a journalist, where he’s reported from the earthquake-ravaged Haiti, post-tsunami Sri Lanka, and centenarian-packed Okinawa. Throughout it all, he’s maintained his commitment to accuracy, evidence, and effective communication. “One of my favorite quotes that I often say when we’re getting into editorial meetings…is this quote by Mark Twain: ‘I would have written you a shorter letter, but I didn’t have the time.’” Whether doing a podcast or on television, it’s difficult to be concise, he said. “You’re asking for people’s time, and you want to make their time really count.” And when the story is told with clarity and concision—while being “as primary sourced as possible, evidence based as possible,” Gupta says, that’s the winning formula.

Switch To Beeps Mode India head coach Gautam Gambhir is facing the flak, with England taking control of the ongoing 4th Test in Manchester. Down 1-2 in the five-match series, India trail England by 186 runs in at the end of Day 3 in the fourth Test. India endured arguably their worst day on the field on Day 3 of the Manchester Test as Joe Root 's record-breaking 150 put the hosts in complete command. With India needing nothing less than a miracle to make comeback in the series, fans criticised Gambhir for the team's recent decline in Test cricket. Fans accused Gambhir for forcing senior players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma into early retirements, and for ignoring some in-form players for the ongoing tour.

The last time India conceded a total of above 500 runs away from home was during the Sydney Test against Australia in 2015, when the Aussies scored 572/7 declared, with centuries from David Warner and Steve Smith being the standouts. Post that game, there have been three 500-plus totals against India in Tests, all by England: 537 (Rajkot, 2016, with centuries from Joe Root, Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes ), 578 (Chennai, 2021, with 218 by Joe Root as a highlight) and this one. Coming to the Manchester Test, England started off their day at 225/2, with Ollie Pope (20*) and Joe Root (11*) unbeaten. The duo went on to have a century partnership, building on exploits of openers Ben Duckett (94 in 100 balls, with 13 fours) and Zak Crawley (84 in 113 balls, with 13 fours and a six), they took England to 332/2 at the first session end, with both having scored their fifties. In the second session, while Washington Sundar (2/57) removed Ollie (71 in 128 balls, seven fours) and Harry Brook (3), skipper Stokes and Root thwarted any further resistance from India as Root completed his 38th Test ton and going past Ricky Ponting to become the second-highest Test run-getter. England ended second session at 433/4, with Stokes and Root unbeaten. Siraj and Bumrah faced fitness issues during the session, having walked off the field, with Bumrah contributing only one over with the new ball. Stokes, while he completed his fifty during the final session went off the field due to trouble in his left leg. Root was removed by Jadeja for a brilliant 150 in 248, consisting of 14 fours. Bumrah and Siraj removed Jamie Smith (9) and Chris Woakes (4) quickly, reducing England to 528/7, but Stokes (77*) came back to bat and along with Liam Dawson (21*) kept any other possible disaster at bay.

Nobody knows why he is there in the team. You don't pick some irrespective if they do well and take others even if they don't.\" When Gambhir was asked the question, he said: \"It's unfair that you are not even sparing a 23-year-old kid to run your YouTube channel,\" Gambhir, known for his combative nature on and off the field, said after the match. \"It's unfair because, after all, his father is not some ex-chairman, an ex-cricketer, or an NRI. Whatever cricket he has played, he has played on his own merit, and in the future too, he will play on his own merit.” The 44-year-old took exception to Srikkanth's views as he saw the latter's comments as one that was made in bad faith. “Targeting someone individually is not fair. You can target someone for their performance, and for that, there are people... there are selectors,” he said. “But when you say such things to a 23-year-old kid, and then social media amplifies it even more, just imagine his mindset when he hears all this. Tomorrow, even your kid could end up playing for the country. The least one can do is realise that he is not 33 years old; he is just 23. You can criticise me; I can handle it. But a 23-year-old boy is a 23-year-old boy, and this is unacceptable.\" He also implored the wider cricket community to ignore the white noise around the Delhi pacer. \"Target their performance, not the individual,” he said. Apart from Srikkanth, the likes of R Ashwin have also questioned Rana's place in the side. This is of course not the first time that Gambhir has hit back at criticism levelled at him by former cricketers. After Sunil Gavaskar, in a regular column, had questioned Gambhir for not taking an equal share of the prize money post the Champions Trophy, he had said: \"It's people's job to criticise me, and they should criticise. \"But there are some people who have been sitting in the commentary box for 20-25 years. They questioned everything I did. They think that Indian cricket is their property. Unfortunately, Indian cricket is not someone's property. It is the identity of 140 crore Indians and it will remain that way.

As fans and selectors alike rode on his ascendancy, he has only grown in metaphorical stature over the period of time to laud over rivals and contemporaries alike. Debuting in 2003, the left-hander remained on the fringes of the ODI side. After a 96 in only his third Test innings against South Africa in 2004, he reached his maiden ton against Bangladesh in the same year. Yet, in an Indian top order that underwent immense experimentation between Ganguly, Sehwag, Tendulkar and Dravid; Gambhir always floated around the periphery. The same unsettled top order was a part of India's poor showing in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, in which Gambhir didn't feature. He returned as a part of the young Indian side that won the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 the same year. It started an ascendancy of orbital proportions for both India and Gambhir. After being given an extended opportunity to partner Sehwag in both forms of the game, he started to blossom. Gambhir was involved in India's first victory in New Zealand in four decades, in addition to his role in denying Australia bragging rights in the Border-Gavaskar trophy. To top that, there were the series victories against the touring Sri Lankan and English sides. The man they fondly call 'Gauti' excelled in these outings as he mastered the art of facing spin bowling and formed one half of what became one of the most dominating opening partnerships in modern cricket. He was a part of the historic Indian team that won the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011 and his solid contribution in the final against Sri Lanka will never be forgotten. Unfortunate to miss out on what could have been a memorable century, that knock of 97 will still rank highly as one of the best in World Cup history. He started the Indian T20 League with the Delhi franchise but after three seasons, he moved out to Kolkata where he got a chance to lead the side. His leadership saw them lift their first League title in 2012 and many players in the side lauded him as an astute leader. His international career took a downward spiral in early 2013 and he was left out from all formats of the game. Gambhir didn't give up and kept working hard in domestic cricket. He performed brilliantly in the 2016 Duleep Trophy and was tough to ignore. An untimely injury to KL Rahul in the New Zealand series meant Gambhir returned to the national team after a gap of two years. However, his comeback didn’t last long as just after two Test matches, he once again was dropped. In the month of December 2018, Gambhir eventually announced his retirement from all forms of cricket and joined politics before the 2019 General Election.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/players/563-gautam-gambhir-playerprofile", "domain": "sports.ndtv.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 0.92, "content_length": 2781}, {"source_number": 4, "title": "Wikipedia Gautam Gambhir - Wikipedia", "snippet": "2 weeks ago - Gautam Gambhir (born 14 October 1981) is a former international cricketer , former politician, and philanthropist who is the current head coach of the Indian cricket team.

Many have voiced or thought it since it became clear Gambhir was to take over as the India men's team's head coach from Rahul Dravid , whose extended tenure finished with the T20 World Cup in June. Gambhir has never held a formal coaching designation in his time as part of the back-room staff at the two IPL franchises he has worked at since retiring from playing cricket in 2018. At Lucknow Super Giants he was the mentor for two seasons, 2022 and 2023, a role he also performed at Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024, when they won the title. Related Coaching? It's all about the vibes, man Wobbly SL look for respite against red-hot India Firebrand and team man: What to expect from Gambhir as India's new coach? 'Trust, freedom, success' - Gambhir lays out his coaching philosophy Gambhir on working with Kohli: 'We are going to be on the same page' He has likely never performed some of the basic jobs coaches normally carry out: being directly involved in planning the structure of training sessions, giving throwdowns, making adjustments to the techniques of players, and so on. Flower has been hands-on with these aspects since he moved into a highly successful coaching career that has now lasted about two decades, during which he has been head coach at England and at several domestic T20 league sides, including currently Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Southern Brave in the Hundred. He understands Gambhir's strengths on the coaching bench, having been head coach at Super Giants during Gambhir's two seasons there. \"He's certainly got some of the characteristics of a successful coach,\" he says. \"He hasn't really coached, though, has he? He is not your conventional coach.\" Flower does think Gambhir has some of the key qualities necessary to succeed in his new role. \"It would probably be better to describe him as an inspirational leader than a coach. That might be more accurate. He's a guy that has the conviction and courage of his own beliefs and principles that will allow other people to really want to follow him. \"Followers or teams like to trust that their leader has the courage of his convictions. And GG definitely has that. He has strong opinions. He knows where he wants to go. He's willing to make tough decisions, and he will have a very clear idea of the type of cricket that he wants his teams to play.\" Gambhir's contract is expected to run until the end of the 2027 ODI World Cup, which means he has more than three years for which to draw up plans. His appointment coincides with a phase of transition in Indian cricket; the selection panel, led by Ajit Agarkar, is keen to blood several young players who they hope will be ready to fill the positions that will fall vacant in the next few years when the likes of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja move on. \"The biggest difference between the two jobs [franchise and international cricket],\" Flower says, \"is that in the international arena you are developing a team and you are developing individuals with a medium- to long-term outlook. Franchise cricket is more about short-term results and getting a bunch of disparate individuals together heading in one direction and believing in something in a very short space of time. \"Whereas in international cricket you have just more time for individual development and to develop a deeper culture in the group. [Gambhir] will be doing three formats, so those might differ a little. They might have different captains, for instance, different senior players, but the tenets and principles of the culture and the unit that you are developing across three formats will be similar.\" **** Intense, passionate, in-your-face - these are qualities we have come to associate with Gambhir as a person, player, commentator, and as a mentor on the IPL circuit. Venkatesh Iyer , the India and KKR allrounder, provides an example of how Gambhir does not pull punches in delivering home truths. It happened minutes after Punjab Kings had recorded the biggest successful chase in T20 cricket , reaching the 262-run target set by Knight Riders at Eden Gardens in this year's IPL. \"We were all in shock, but what he told us was absolute truth,\" Iyer says. \"He told us that we didn't bowl and we didn't stick to our plans. The meeting we had that day was revolutionary because after that meeting, it's our bowling that won us all the games in the IPL. That is a day that every KKR player remembers because that's when things started to turn around for us.\" Iyer, who has been a key player for Knight Riders in the past few years, also brings up the match against Delhi Capitals in early April where he batted at No. 7. \"I remember the game against RCB where I got a half-century [from No. 3], and in the next game I got to bat only one [two] ball", "url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/what-to-expect-from-gautam-gambhir-and-what-he-needs-to-expect-1445341", "domain": "espncricinfo.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 9, "title": "England vs India, cricket 2025: Gautam Gambhir ’s controversies...", "snippet": "July 31st, 2025 8:50 am.

The giant “groundsman” at the centre of the latest storm to unfold in the series between England and India is not the first person to be stung by the combative former opener and nor, based on an extended history, will he be the last.

Gambhir’s dismissive language towards Fortis has drawn criticism given issues of equality in class and caste remain problematic in India. The Indian coach was displeased with the behaviour of Ben Stokes and Harry Brook, who moaned with Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar refused to play the game on English terms, at Old Trafford last weekend. But the latest controversy reflects poorly on Gambhir, who is under pressure. Nor is it the first time his temper has got the better of himself, having been embroiled in contentious moments over two decades at the elite level. MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - JULY 23: India coach Gautam Gambhir talks with captain Shubman Gill of India during Day One of the 4th Rothesay Test Match between England and India at Emirates Old Trafford on July 23, 2025 in Manchester, England. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images Digging an elbow in The 2009 ICC Test Cricketer of the Year had cemented his spot in the Indian team and had an air of surety about him when he endured an infamous run-in with Aussie all-rounder Shane Watson during the Border-Gavaskar Series in 2008. Gambhir was batting superbly on the way to scoring 149 in the first innings in Delhi when, during the middle session, he ran directly at Watson and dropped an elbow into him while also engaging in heated chatter with Simon Katich later in the afternoon. Similarly to the dismissive language he used at The Oval this week, Gambhir spluttered after stumps that he scarcely had any need to worry about Watson given his superiority in skill. “It wasn’t deliberate. It just happened. I didn’t need to get into this argument with Shane Watson because he had no option of getting me out. There wasn’t a need for me to stick my elbow out,” he said. “That’s part of the game. They were really desperate to get me out because of the way I was batting and were trying to break my concentration. But the important thing was to just be there, not back out, and keep up the concentration.” Referee Chris Broad did not agree, with Gambhir fortunate to only miss the next Test in Nagpur through suspension. “The decision to find Gambhir guilty of a level two offence is indicative of the fact that any degree of physical contact is unacceptable. Had Gambhir been charged with and found guilty of a charge under 2.4, due to his previous offence, I would have been obliged to impose a minimum penalty of a two-Test match ban,” he said. “In the view of the umpires, the facts of this case — the lightness of the physical conduct and the element of provocation — would not justify such a penalty. I have also taken into account the previous offences of Gambhir and therefore, I am satisfied that the penalty imposed is an appropriate outcome in the circumstances of this matter.” That provocation Broad referred to? As Brett Lee later noted when appearing on a vodcast with the Indian coach, Gambhir did have deal with a barrage from himself and Watson, who was fined 10 per cent of his match fee for a breach of the ICC Code of Conduct. “I still remember it was very funny, (though) not funny at the time, (but) the little incident between me, Shane Watson, staring at GG, throwing the ball at him. And then a little elbow came at Watson. That was hilarious,” Lee said. Gambhir, with a rueful smile, lamented the incident was “very expensive”. “Everything I’ve done has been very expensive. Either my 50 per cent match fees have been cut or I’ve been banned,” he said.

England’s new white-ball head coach Brendon McCullum has backed his Indian counterpart Gautam Gambhir amid a wave of scrutiny over his coaching credentials. McCullum, who played with Gambhir at Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), called him a ‘really strong leader of men’ who can utilize India’s full potential. Since Gambhir has joined skipper Rohit Sharma as India’s head coach, the team has lost an ODI series against Sri Lanka and six of the ten Tests. The team’s T20 results in this phase have been much better, though, with clinical series wins over South Africa, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. Recommended Stories “What I will say about Gautam Gambhir is I’ve worked with him before and he’s an outstanding leader,\" McCullum said in a press conference in Kolkata on Monday. “He’s a really strong leader of men and in the time that he’s had in any sort of leadership positions which he’s held previously, he’s been able to excel I’m sure.\" “He’s only just sort of got underway with this team, but there’s no doubt that he’ll get the best out of the talent that he’s got, and we’ve got to find a way to be able to counter that with our own style,\" he added. McCullum and Gambhir have a common Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) connection. The former was KKR’s head coach and his impressive style earned him England’s red-ball coach job; good work here has earned him the white-ball gig, too. The five T20Is and three ODIs against India are his first in the job. Gambhir, meanwhile, got the role across formats for India after winning IPL 2024 with KKR as the team mentor. top videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all “I don’t really know, sometimes I don’t even know if coach is the right word to be honest,\" McCullum said, speaking about his approach. “I think everyone does things really differently, and everyone’s approaches are very unique and from how I try and operate, I think it’s probably less of a coach and try and make sure that the environment is a happy and enjoyable environment where you guys feel as if they can push their talents and push themselves towards the uncomfortable situations and know that there’s still going to be that support and that care there afterward and be encouraged to go again towards those.\" “Other coaches are very different, they like to run quite structured, quite technical. Other coaches are probably a bit more regimented in the way that they go about things, but I guess it’s really different,\" he added.

Many have voiced or thought it since it became clear Gambhir was to take over as the India men's team's head coach from Rahul Dravid , whose extended tenure finished with the T20 World Cup in June. Gambhir has never held a formal coaching designation in his time as part of the back-room staff at the two IPL franchises he has worked at since retiring from playing cricket in 2018. At Lucknow Super Giants he was the mentor for two seasons, 2022 and 2023, a role he also performed at Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024, when they won the title. He has likely never performed some of the basic jobs coaches normally carry out: being directly involved in planning the structure of training sessions, giving throwdowns, making adjustments to the techniques of players, and so on. Flower has been hands-on with these aspects since he moved into a highly successful coaching career that has now lasted about two decades, during which he has been head coach at England and at several domestic T20 league sides, including currently Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Southern Brave in the Hundred. He understands Gambhir's strengths on the coaching bench, having been head coach at Super Giants during Gambhir's two seasons there. \"He's certainly got some of the characteristics of a successful coach,\" he says. \"He hasn't really coached, though, has he? He is not your conventional coach.\" Flower does think Gambhir has some of the key qualities necessary to succeed in his new role. \"It would probably be better to describe him as an inspirational leader than a coach. That might be more accurate. He's a guy that has the conviction and courage of his own beliefs and principles that will allow other people to really want to follow him. \"Followers or teams like to trust that their leader has the courage of his convictions. And GG definitely has that. He has strong opinions. He knows where he wants to go. He's willing to make tough decisions, and he will have a very clear idea of the type of cricket that he wants his teams to play.\" Gambhir's contract is expected to run until the end of the 2027 ODI World Cup, which means he has more than three years for which to draw up plans. His appointment coincides with a phase of transition in Indian cricket; the selection panel, led by Ajit Agarkar, is keen to blood several young players who they hope will be ready to fill the positions that will fall vacant in the next few years when the likes of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja move on. \"The biggest difference between the two jobs [franchise and international cricket],\" Flower says, \"is that in the international arena you are developing a team and you are developing individuals with a medium- to long-term outlook. Franchise cricket is more about short-term results and getting a bunch of disparate individuals together heading in one direction and believing in something in a very short space of time. \"Whereas in international cricket you have just more time for individual development and to develop a deeper culture in the group. [Gambhir] will be doing three formats, so those might differ a little. They might have different captains, for instance, different senior players, but the tenets and principles of the culture and the unit that you are developing across three formats will be similar.\" **** Intense, passionate, in-your-face - these are qualities we have come to associate with Gambhir as a person, player, commentator, and as a mentor on the IPL circuit. Venkatesh Iyer , the India and KKR allrounder, provides an example of how Gambhir does not pull punches in delivering home truths. It happened minutes after Punjab Kings had recorded the biggest successful chase in T20 cricket , reaching the 262-run target set by Knight Riders at Eden Gardens in this year's IPL. \"We were all in shock, but what he told us was absolute truth,\" Iyer says. \"He told us that we didn't bowl and we didn't stick to our plans. The meeting we had that day was revolutionary because after that meeting, it's our bowling that won us all the games in the IPL. That is a day that every KKR player remembers because that's when things started to turn around for us.\" Iyer, who has been a key player for Knight Riders in the past few years, also brings up the match against Delhi Capitals in early April where he batted at No. 7. \"I remember the game against RCB where I got a half-century [from No. 3], and in the next game I got to bat only one [two] balls against Delhi. I remember him coming and talking to me about how it feels when you are doing well and still not getting to bat. \"For a mentor to come and talk to me like that means a lot. And also before the season, the way he spoke to me, the way he handled me - because I did not score a lot in the practice games, but", "url": "https://www.espn.com/cricket/story/_/id/40669746/what-expect-gautam-gambhir-needs-expect", "domain": "espn.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 13, "title": "Gautam Gambhir Is A 'Hypocrite': Former India Cricketer Slams Head...", "snippet": "Manoj Tiwary criticised head coach Gautam Gambhir for omitting Yashasvi Jaiswal from India's Asia Cup 2025 squad, and his silence on the scheduled IND vs PAK cricket match.", "full_content": "Gautam Gambhir Is A 'Hypocrite': Former India Cricketer Slams Head Coach, Asks 'What Will He Do Now' Manoj Tiwary criticised head coach Gautam Gambhir for omitting Yashasvi Jaiswal from India's Asia Cup 2025 squad, and his silence on the scheduled IND vs PAK cricket match O Outlook Sports Desk Updated on: 26 August 2025 4:58 pm Updated on: 26 August 2025 4:58 pm SUBSCRIBE Captain Suryakumar Yadav (right) with coach Gautam Gambhir at a training session ahead of the fourth India vs England T20I in Pune.

What will he do now? Raising the ethical concerns regarding the scheduled India vs Pakistan encounter in the wake of recent cross-border incidents, Tiwary continued: \"He's the coach of the team that's going to play Pakistan in the Asia Cup. Why can't he just resign and say that I will not be part of Team India because you are playing with Pakistan?\" Related Content Ravi Shastri Welcomes BCCI’s New Family Travel Policy, Praises Captain Gill’s Leadership India Vs West Indies, 2nd Test: Gautam Gambhir Slams Delhi Pitch, Wants More For Fast Bowlers Gautam Gambhir Organizes Open-Air Dinner For Team India Before Delhi Test, Weather May Play Spoilsport: Report India Vs Pakistan Final, Asia Cup 2025 Gems: Reactions And Quotable Quotes Related Content Ravi Shastri Welcomes BCCI’s New Family Travel Policy, Praises Captain Gill’s Leadership India Vs West Indies, 2nd Test: Gautam Gambhir Slams Delhi Pitch, Wants More For Fast Bowlers Gautam Gambhir Organizes Open-Air Dinner For Team India Before Delhi Test, Weather May Play Spoilsport: Report India Vs Pakistan Final, Asia Cup 2025 Gems: Reactions And Quotable Quotes The Sports Ministry, earlier this month, unveiled a new policy declaring that India and Pakistan will not engage in any bilateral sporting contests, even if hosted at neutral venues. The policy, however, makes an exception for multilateral tournaments, ensuring India’s participation in next month’s Asia Cup . The policy, uploaded on the Ministry’s official website, does spark broader debates about the impact of geopolitical tensions on sporting decisions. The Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people in May led to a military showdown with India launching Operation Sindoor. \"India's approach to sports events involving Pakistan reflects its overall policy in dealing with that country,” the ministry stated. “In so far as bilateral sports events in each other's country are concerned, Indian teams will not be participating in competitions in Pakistan. Nor will we permit Pakistani teams to play in India.” Tiwary And Gambhir: History Of Clashes Fuels Current Criticism Manoj Tiwary’s public criticism is underpinned by a history of personal and professional clashes with Gautam Gambhir, dating back to their overlapping tenure at Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and several incidents in domestic cricket. Tiwary, who played 12 ODIs and three T20Is for India, has recounted heated arguments, on-field verbal tussles, and alleged threats by Gambhir during key matches, including a Ranji Trophy encounter. For the unversed, Tiwary's rivalry with Gambhir has roots in the Indian Premier League 2013 season, when both played for KKR and reportedly clashed over batting order decisions. In 2015, Tiwary alleged that Gambhir used abusive language during a Ranji Trophy match between Bengal and Delhi, which led to a formal complaint to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The BCCI disciplinary committee reviewed the incident but did not issue public sanctions. In his latest interview, Tiwary said: \"My relationship with him will never be good. It will never be good because I know what he has done. And a lot of things he has said which will be difficult to forget.\" India's Squad For Asia Cup 2025: Tiwary Ratchets Up Criticism Manoj Tiwary also lambasted Gambhir for ", "url": "https://www.outlookindia.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-asia-cup-2025-manoj-tiwary-gautam-gambhir-clashes", "domain": "outlookindia.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 14, "title": "Cricbuzz Gautam Gambhir Profile - ICC Ranking, Age, Career Info & Stats | Cricbuzz.com", "snippet": "Gautam Gambhir's cricketing career ... and of course the proverbial acche din and bure din.

Gambhir's journey as a first-class cricketer began in the 1999-2000 season. But, it was a couple of years later, in 2002, that the Delhi lad first stole the spotlight. Then playing for the Board President's XI against a touring Zimbabwe team, the left-hander smashed a double century scoring 218 runs. A year later, came the big moment: Gambhir secured his place in the Indian team for the TVS Cup, a triangular fixture. Not as gifted as some of his contemporaries, initially Gambhir had to grin and bear it when selectors would just choose to overlook him. However, what separated him from the pack was his passion for the game and an almost insatiable appetite for runs. At the topmost level, the stakes are high. Bowlers keep an eye out for even the minutest of shortcomings in the best of batsmen. And Gambhir had a chink in his otherwise formidable armour: His front foot would fall over a bit, which often made him an easy LBW prey to quality fast bowlers. This flaw in the technique proved to be the recurrent glitch that kept his bat quiet between 2003 and 2006. Having fixed the fault, Gambhir was again in the reckoning, scoring enough to stake a claim for a place in India's 2007 ODI World Cup squad. But, the selectors thought otherwise. They preferred to instead go with hard-hitting right-hander Robin Uthappa, who had, under his belt, some match-winning knocks at the top of the order. The rejection severely jolted Gambhir, who even contemplated quitting the game. But, destiny had other plans in store for him. The same year in September, Gambhir was called back to open the batting with his Delhi mate Virender Sehwag for the T-20 World Cup. He grabbed the opportunity with both hands. In the high-voltage final against Pakistan, Gambhir showed nerves of steel scoring 75 runs that made all the difference. He was the second highest scorer in the tournament with 227 runs in the 7 innings. After that feat, Gambhir always enjoyed the backing of skipper MS Dhoni, but failed to break into the team. It was sheer hard luck, as legends of the game like Tendulkar still graced the Indian top-order. Gambhir was on the top of his game between 2008 and 2011. Always looking aggressive on the field, he hit the purple patch in those years scoring big and often match-winning knocks. In the 2008 CB series Down Under, Gambhir blazed a trail when he outscored the likes of Sachin, Ponting and Sangakara to emerge as the highest run-scorer of that ODI tri-series. Soon, Gambhir cemented his place in the ODI team, filling the big shoes of iconic left-hander Sourav Ganguly. The spectacular showing in the ODIs, earned him a place in the Test team, too. Having scored his first Test century against Bangladesh at Chittagong in 2004 , it took Gambhir almost four years to score his second test ton. But the third one came only nine days after. Of his 9 test centuries, the one he scored at Napier in New Zealand in 2009 will be remembered for long. Batting for a staggering 643 minutes, Gambhir showed grit deploying his stoic defence and scoring a match-saving 137 runs. By 2009, Gambhir had established himself as one of the top batsmen in International cricket. The same year, he received the prestigious ICC Test Cricketer of The Year award. Two years later, his decisive knock in the final of the 2011 ODI World Cup, which India won, made him a national hero of sorts. Post -2011 World Cup, many even saw Gambhir as next-in-line to MS Dhoni. But then came the slide in his fortunes. One bad series was followed by another, runs dried up and questions begun to be asked of his technique. In the 17 Test matches between 2011 and 2012, he averaged just 31. Eventually, he faced the axe.

In Firefox, after searching for some keyword in Google and getting a list of results, I would like to copy the link address of a particular result. But I find that the link address is not the actual address, but some modification by Google to include some information about Google itself. For example, search \"regex Is it worth using Python re.compile\" in Google, and the first result is \"regex - Is it worth using Python's re.compile? - Stack Overflow\" whose address ishttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/452104/is-it-worth-using-pythons-re-compile.

I remember Google search used to work in the same way as I wish, but now it has changed. I was wondering if I am missing something and how to do as I wish? There's aGreasemonkey scriptthat can change the Google Search result links back to direct links, then you can simply copy and paste them like normal links on the web. Simplest method without scripts or any other troublesome stuff. Tried and tested in Firefox and Internet Explorer. You insert the copied link from Google results and get clean URL without Google redirection code. The actual link location is located directly below the link description. You could copy and paste it from there. I assume the added stuff is so that Google can log when others are accessing that site link. If the problem is the link length, you could try using aURL shortening service. There's aGreasemonkey Scriptthat will disable what you're talking about. In Chrome Win7X64, right clicking whitespace away from a link, and releasing that click over the link, worked perfectly for me on a lengthy .ppt, just as suggested by benczur. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fohrms%2Fdockets%2Fac%2F05%2Fslides%2F2005-4144s1_05_Mendelson-HF-NHD%2520Pane.ppt&ei=NOFBUYKHBM-64APKnYGQAw&usg=AFQjCNGka328-0Jym7wOYtJ8pdgGJjLv6Q&sig2=Iq2vS_O3AfCioprk-j_q2w http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/slides/2005-4144s1_05_Mendelson-HF-NHD%20Pane.ppt If you click on the result, and open such a page, you will see that the address bar in the top of your browser (where it says http://*), the address will also change tohttp://www.python.org/. You can copy the address from there.What Ryan said is also true, but the problem is that google also shortens links (ex: \"nl.wikipedia.org/.../Python_(programmeertaal)\"). I also thought what you said happens, but looks like it doesn't: Any possibility this is browser dependent? Which browser are you using? (Screenshot from Firefox 4, same behavior in Chrome, both on OSX 10.6) I thought this may be dependent whether you are signed in to Google or not. But it is not. The behavior is the same. You can simply right click on your mouse and click on \"inspect element\" (on Google Chrome) and your full link will appear somewhere (you can hitCtrl+Fand enter some keywords of your link to find it quickly). Another way of doing it, is the following: before you do a right click on the link, open developer tools (F12) and select the link with dots: In html code you will see the proper link that you can copy/paste where you need it. You can also use the scroogle site (http://www.scroogle.org/cgi-bin/scraper.htm) which is primarlily aimed at \"google privacy concerns\", bit a side effect is it produces direct links. Scroogle is occasionally \"broken\"/doesn't work, mostly after google adds some innovation that changes the way it works. It also won't give you the same answers as google, if your results have geographic weighting, or other non-generic search order issues. It was quite easy to write PHP script for decoding \"google's links\" to normal URLs. Here is it:http://george.vps.websupport.sk/google/ For Firefox, theCopy Real Url pluginsolves the problem for me. Found this while searching for a simple little plugin I had installed in Safari (as far as I call recall) on my previous Mac. In case someone is still looking, it is now a browser extension on The one from userscript mentioned before doesn't work no. If you are using chrome, you can try this extension:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-google-redirects/ccenmflbeofaceccfhhggbagkblihpoh Benczur's answer has been the simplest one for me to use, without extra tools needed, but as pointed out, in recent versions of Firefox (in my case it's 35.0.1) a context menu pops up right after clicking the mouse left button, not after releasing it, so the trick doesn't work anymore.

Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. Access the demo account To access the demo account, click one of the three links at the end of this section. When you click a link: If you already have a Google account, you're prompted to log in to that account. If you don't have a Google account, you're prompted to create an account and then log in. When you click a link below, you agree to let Google perform one of 2 actions related to your Google account: If you already have a Google Analytics account, we will add the demo account to your Analytics account. If you don't have a Google Analytics account, we will create one for you in association with your Google account, and then add the demo account to your new Analytics account. The demo account is available from the account selector in Analytics where you select organization and account links. The demo account counts against the maximum number of Analytics accounts you're permitted to create under a single Google account. The current maximum for Google Analytics is 2000 Analytics accounts per Google account. Access the demo account, which contains three properties, by clicking one of the following links based on the property you would like to access first. You can change to the other properties at any time by using the account selector . Google Analytics property: Google Merchandise Store (web data) Google Analytics property: Flood-It! (app and web data) You can remove the demo account at any time. Where the data comes from The data in the Google Analytics demo account is from the Google Merchandise Store and Flood-It! . The Google Merchandise Store is an ecommerce site that sells Google-branded merchandise. These 2 properties contain data in the account that is typical of what you would see for an ecommerce site, and include the following kinds of information: Traffic source data. Information about where website users originate. This includes information about organic traffic, paid search traffic, and display traffic. Content data. Information about the behavior of users on the site. This includes the URLs of pages that users look at, and how they interact with page content. Transaction data. Information about the transactions that occur on the Google Merchandise Store website. Flood-It! is a simple yet exciting strategy puzzle game in which you have to flood the whole game board with one color in fewer than the allowed steps. The game is available for download on Android and iOS . There is a Google Analytics property for Flood-It! containing games reporting and data from the app and website that includes the following kinds of information: Calculated metrics. Information that is computed from existing metrics . This includes metrics like Average revenue per active user and Average engagement time. It also includes Buyer conversion and Revenue heartbeat , which are based on Google Play’s recommended key performance indicators . Events data. Information about user interaction with content. This includes events like level completion and level resets. Ecommerce data. Information related to in-app purchases. Ways to use the demo account Because the demo account shows actual data from an ecommerce website, it's useful for exploring Google Analytics reports and features. Here are a few things you can do with the 2 Google Analytics properties: View the standard Google Analytics reporting in the Merchandise Store property. Explore games reporting in the Flood-It property. Do basic analysis, such as: Which channel is responsible for acquiring the most new users across your different platforms? How many total unique users does each business have? How many conversions have occurred on the Flood-It! app and Merchandise Store website in the last week? Perform funnel exploration : Where do users enter the conversion funnel, and where do they drop off? Conduct ad-hoc explorations by dragging and dropping multiple variables—the different segments, dimensions, and metrics you use to measure a business—onto a canvas to see instant visualizations of your data.

Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search. When sending data over HTTPS, I know the content is encrypted, however I hear mixed answers about whether the headers are encrypted, or how much of the header is encrypted. All the HTTP headers are encrypted†. That's why SSL on vhosts doesn't work too well - you need a dedicated IP address because the Host header is encrypted. †The Server Name Identification (SNI) standard means that the hostname may not be encrypted if you're using TLS. Also, whether you're using SNI or not, the TCP and IP headers are never encrypted. (If they were, your packets would not be routable.) The headers are entirely encrypted. The only information going over the network 'in the clear' is related to the SSL setup and D/H key exchange. This exchange is carefully designed not to yield any useful information to eavesdroppers, and once it has taken place, all data is encrypted. New answer to old question, sorry. I thought I'd add my $.02 So, your browser's URL (and title, in some cases) can display the querystring (which usually contain the most sensitive details) and some details in the header; the browser knows some header information (content type, unicode, etc); and browser history, password management, favorites/bookmarks, and cached pages will all contain the querystring. Server logs on the remote end can also contain querystring as well as some content details. Also, the URL isn't always secure: the domain, protocol, and port are visible - otherwise routers don't know where to send your requests. Also, if you've got an HTTP proxy, the proxy server knows the address, usually they don't know the full querystring. So if the data is moving, it's generally protected. If it's not in transit, it's not encrypted. Not to nit pick, but data at the end is also decrypted, and can be parsed, read, saved, forwarded, or discarded at will. And, malware at either end can take snapshots of data entering (or exiting) the SSL protocol - such as (bad) Javascript inside a page inside HTTPS which can surreptitiously make http (or https) calls to logging websites (since access to local harddrive is often restricted and not useful). Also, cookies are not encrypted under the HTTPS protocol, either. Developers wanting to store sensitive data in cookies (or anywhere else for that matter) need to use their own encryption mechanism. As to cache, most modern browsers won't cache HTTPS pages, but that fact is not defined by the HTTPS protocol, it is entirely dependent on the developer of a browser to be sure not to cache pages received through HTTPS. So if you're worried about packet sniffing, you're probably okay. But if you're worried about malware or someone poking through your history, bookmarks, cookies, or cache, you are not out of the water yet. HTTP version 1.1 added a special HTTP method, CONNECT - intended to create the SSL tunnel, including the necessary protocol handshake and cryptographic setup.The regular requests thereafter all get sent wrapped in the SSL tunnel, headers and body inclusive. HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) sends all HTTP content over a SSL tunel, so HTTP content and headers are encrypted as well. With SSL the encryption is at the transport level, so it takes place before a request is sent. Everything in the HTTPS message is encrypted, including the headers, and the request/response load. the URL is also encrypted, you really only have the IP, Port and if SNI, the host name that are unencrypted. To understand, what is encrypted and what not, you need to know that SSL/TLS is the layer between the transport-layer and the application-layer. in the case of HTTPS, HTTP is the application-layer, and TCP the transport-layer. That means, all Headers below the SSL-Level are unencrypted. Also, SSL itself may expose data. The exposed data includes(for each layer's Header): NOTE: Additional Data might be exposed too, but this data is pretty sure to be exposed. Theoretically, you can encrypt the TCP-Headers, but that is hard to implement. Usually, a browser won't just connect to the destination host by IP immediantely using HTTPS, there are some earlier requests, that might expose the following information(if your client is not a browser, it might behave differently, but the DNS request is pretty common): DNS: This request is being sent to get the correct IP address of a server. It will include the hostname, and its result will include all IP addresses belonging to the server. HTTP: the first request to your server. A browser will only use SSL/TLS if instructed to, unencrypted HTTP is used first. Usually, this will result in a redirect to the seucre site.

Maybe there is a browser plugin which visits resolves all URLs and replaces them?

There are also extensions available in the Opera add-ons repository: Just in case you consider installing/updating extensions to be more convenient than userscripts. I have found that this script works as of July 2012:http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/120330 In general, every time Google changes the way it adds a redirection link, someone is making a new script on userscripts.org - so if the above is out of date, just find a new one!

In case if you are inclined to do usingmod_rewrite: If you are looking for a301 Permanent Redirect, then the redirect flag should be as, I needed this for something as simple as redirecting all HTTP traffic from the default Apache home page on my server to one served over HTTPS. Since I'm still quitegreenwhen it comes to configuring Apache, I prefer to avoid usingmod_rewritedirectly and instead went for something simpler like this: I like this because it allowed me to use Apache variables.

Speaking at a launch event for his book 'I Have the Streets - A Kutti Cricket Story', Ashwin mentioned that Gambhir is a \"very misunderstood person\". Having won IPL 2024 as mentor of the Kolkata Knight Riders, Gambhir is the favourite to succeed Rahul Dravid and take over charge of the Indian team after the 2024 T20 World Cup. Ashwin recalled how Gambhir had supported him during his early days in the Indian team. \"I was playing my first full series, after only carrying drinks for the first two years. It was he (Gambhir) who gave me a lot of confidence at the beginning,\" said Ashwin. \"I was not used to someone beyond my state giving me that sort of confidence,\" recalled Ashwin. Ashwin hails from Tamil Nadu in southern India, while Gambhir is from Delhi in northern India. Gambhir's attitude and aggression is often misunderstood, said Ashwin. \"Gautam Gambhir is a very misunderstood person. He is a fighter,\" he said. \"We give hero status to someone in our mind, and forget about everyone else. This is a sport, not a movie,\" Ashwin added. \"There are no heroes and villains. Gambhir is a competitor. His desire and hunger to win is unbelievable. I have a massive amount of respect for him,\" said Ashwin. Gambhir had recently also appeared on Ashwin's own podcast 'Kutti Stories with Ash', as the two met ahead of a clash between KKR and Rajasthan Royals, Ashwin's franchise in IPL 2024. Gambhir has been peppered with several questions about his future, but played down speculation. Speaking at an event hosted by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, Gambhir said, \"I just finished a brilliant journey (with KKR), let's enjoy that.\" Gambhir and former India women's coach WV Raman are going head-to-head for the role of Team India's head coach. Interestingly, the two had worked together for KKR in 2014, when Gambhir was the captain of the franchise and Raman was the batting coach. KKR also happened to win the IPL title that year as well.

He performed brilliantly in the 2016 Duleep Trophy and was tough to ignore. An untimely injury to KL Rahul in the New Zealand series meant Gambhir returned to the national team ...", "full_content": "The manner in which Gautam Gambhir's career took off in 2008, following an initial bedding-in period, is simply stated astronomical. As fans and selectors alike rode on his ascendancy, he has only grown in metaphorical stature over the period of time to laud over rivals and contemporaries alike. Debuting in 2003, the left-hander remained on the fringes of the ODI side. After a 96 in only his third Test innings against South Africa in 2004, he reached his maiden ton against Bangladesh in the same year. Yet, in an Indian top order that underwent immense experimentation between Ganguly, Sehwag, Tendulkar and Dravid; Gambhir always floated around the periphery. The same unsettled top order was a part of India's poor showing in the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, in which Gambhir didn't feature. He returned as a part of the young Indian side that won the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 the same year. It started an ascendancy of orbital proportions for both India and Gambhir. After being given an extended opportunity to partner Sehwag in both forms of the game, he started to blossom. Gambhir was involved in India's first victory in New Zealand in four decades, in addition to his role in denying Australia bragging rights in the Border-Gavaskar trophy. To top that, there were the series victories against the touring Sri Lankan and English sides. The man they fondly call 'Gauti' excelled in these outings as he mastered the art of facing spin bowling and formed one half of what became one of the most dominating opening partnerships in modern cricket. He was a part of the historic Indian team that won the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011 and his solid contribution in the final against Sri Lanka will never be forgotten. Unfortunate to miss out on what could have been a memorable century, that knock of 97 will still rank highly as one of the best in World Cup history. He started the Indian T20 League with the Delhi franchise but after three seasons, he moved out to Kolkata where he got a chance to lead the side. His leadership saw them lift their first League title in 2012 and many players in the side lauded him as an astute leader. His international career took a downward spiral in early 2013 and he was left out from all formats of the game. Gambhir didn't give up and kept working hard in domestic cricket. He performed brilliantly in the 2016 Duleep Trophy and was tough to ignore. An untimely injury to KL Rahul in the New Zealand series meant Gambhir returned to the national team after a gap of two years.

His life andcareerare an inspiration for Indian youth. In this article, we will discuss Gautam Gambhir's life, his cricket career, and future from an astrological perspective. Gautam Gambhir was born on 14 October 1981 in Delhi. His father, Deepak Gambhir, was a clothingbusinessmanand mother, Seema Gambhir, was a housewife. Gautam received his early education at Modern School, Delhi, after which he graduated from Hindu College. Gambhir's inclination towards cricket was evident from childhood, and he started playing cricket at a very young age. Gautam Gambhir's cricketcareerbegan in 1999 when he started playing for Delhi's Ranji team. His excellent performance led to his inclusion in the Indian cricket team in 2003. Gambhir made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in 2003. His real identity was made when he played an important role in the victory of the Indian team in the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Gautam Gambhir was one of the key batsmen of the Indian team in the T20 World Cup held in 2007. He performed brilliantly in the tournament and played animportantrole in the team's victory by scoring 75 runs against Pakistan in the final match. After this victory, Gambhir became an integral part of the Indian cricket team. In 2011, the Indian cricket team won the ODI World Cup under the captaincy of MS Dhoni, and Gautam Gambhir's innings of 97 runs played an important role in this victory. Gambhir's innings took the Indian team out of trouble and led it to victory. This World Cup victory made Gambhir immortal in Indian cricket history. Gautam Gambhir has played many brilliant innings in his cricketcareer. In 2009, he scored 137 and 167 runs in the Test match against New Zealand, which helped the Indian team win the Test series. In 2010, he scored a century against South Africa and pulled the Indian team out of a difficult situation. Gambhir's batting technique and mental toughness made him a successful cricketer. Gautam Gambhir announced his retirement from cricket in 2018. His retirement marked the end of an important era in Indian cricket. Gambhir scored 4,154 runs in 58 Tests and 5,238 runs in 147 ODIs in his career. His contribution will always be remembered. After retiring from cricket, Gautam Gambhir entered politics. In 2019, he won the Lok Sabha election from East Delhi on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket. In Parliament, Gambhir attracted people's attention with his outspoken approach and actions on social issues. His politicalcareerhas focused on issues such as development, security, and cleanliness of Delhi. Gautam Gambhir was born under the sign of Libra, which represents a sense of balance and justice in his personality and career. Librans are just and strive to maintain balance in life. This characteristic of Gambhir is clearly visible in both his cricketcareerand political life. The combination of Sun and Mercury in hishoroscopesymbolizes his excellent leadership ability and communication skills. This combination enables him to take decisions and gives him the ability to present his ideas with clarity. On the other hand, Moon in Cancer signifies his sensitivity and ability to understand the feelings of others. From anastrologicalpoint of view, 2024 can be an important year for Gautam Gambhir.

Many have voiced or thought it since it became clear Gambhir was to take over as the India men's team's head coach from Rahul Dravid , whose extended tenure finished with the T20 World Cup in June. Gambhir has never held a formal coaching designation in his time as part of the back-room staff at the two IPL franchises he has worked at since retiring from playing cricket in 2018. At Lucknow Super Giants he was the mentor for two seasons, 2022 and 2023, a role he also performed at Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024, when they won the title. Related Coaching? It's all about the vibes, man Wobbly SL look for respite against red-hot India Firebrand and team man: What to expect from Gambhir as India's new coach? 'Trust, freedom, success' - Gambhir lays out his coaching philosophy Gambhir on working with Kohli: 'We are going to be on the same page' He has likely never performed some of the basic jobs coaches normally carry out: being directly involved in planning the structure of training sessions, giving throwdowns, making adjustments to the techniques of players, and so on. Flower has been hands-on with these aspects since he moved into a highly successful coaching career that has now lasted about two decades, during which he has been head coach at England and at several domestic T20 league sides, including currently Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Southern Brave in the Hundred. He understands Gambhir's strengths on the coaching bench, having been head coach at Super Giants during Gambhir's two seasons there. \"He's certainly got some of the characteristics of a successful coach,\" he says. \"He hasn't really coached, though, has he? He is not your conventional coach.\" Flower does think Gambhir has some of the key qualities necessary to succeed in his new role. \"It would probably be better to describe him as an inspirational leader than a coach. That might be more accurate. He's a guy that has the conviction and courage of his own beliefs and principles that will allow other people to really want to follow him. \"Followers or teams like to trust that their leader has the courage of his convictions. And GG definitely has that. He has strong opinions. He knows where he wants to go. He's willing to make tough decisions, and he will have a very clear idea of the type of cricket that he wants his teams to play.\" Gambhir's contract is expected to run until the end of the 2027 ODI World Cup, which means he has more than three years for which to draw up plans. His appointment coincides with a phase of transition in Indian cricket; the selection panel, led by Ajit Agarkar, is keen to blood several young players who they hope will be ready to fill the positions that will fall vacant in the next few years when the likes of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja move on. \"The biggest difference between the two jobs [franchise and international cricket],\" Flower says, \"is that in the international arena you are developing a team and you are developing individuals with a medium- to long-term outlook. Franchise cricket is more about short-term results and getting a bunch of disparate individuals together heading in one direction and believing in something in a very short space of time. \"Whereas in international cricket you have just more time for individual development and to develop a deeper culture in the group. [Gambhir] will be doing three formats, so those might differ a little. They might have different captains, for instance, different senior players, but the tenets and principles of the culture and the unit that you are developing across three formats will be similar.\" **** Intense, passionate, in-your-face - these are qualities we have come to associate with Gambhir as a person, player, commentator, and as a mentor on the IPL circuit. Venkatesh Iyer , the India and KKR allrounder, provides an example of how Gambhir does not pull punches in delivering home truths. It happened minutes after Punjab Kings had recorded the biggest successful chase in T20 cricket , reaching the 262-run target set by Knight Riders at Eden Gardens in this year's IPL. \"We were all in shock, but what he told us was absolute truth,\" Iyer says. \"He told us that we didn't bowl and we didn't stick to our plans. The meeting we had that day was revolutionary because after that meeting, it's our bowling that won us all the games in the IPL. That is a day that every KKR player remembers because that's when things started to turn around for us.\" Iyer, who has been a key player for Knight Riders in the past few years, also brings up the match against Delhi Capitals in early April where he batted at No. 7. \"I remember the game against RCB where I got a half-century [from No. 3], and in the next game I got to bat only one [two] ball", "url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/what-to-expect-from-gautam-gambhir-and-what-he-needs-to-expect-1445341", "domain": "espncricinfo.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 7, "title": "Who is Gautam Gambhir , Family, Salary, Education, Net Worth, News", "snippet": "Who is Gautam Gambhir .

Gambhir posted on the social media platform X' after the win Unlike Stokes, Gautam Gambhir supported the idea of introducing injury substitutes, particularly in cases where an injury is visible and prevents a player from fulfilling their role on the field. Touring this part of the world has always been challenging because of the history between the two countries, which can never be forgotten, said Gambhir during his speech The Oval Test (IND vs ENG 5th Test) build-up was marred by a verbal spat between India coach and Surrey groundsman Lee Fortis. Check out full details here Asked whether Gambhir gave a pep talk to the players after day four and made a reference to his match-saving 137 in Napier back in 2009, Gambhir responded in the negative. Gambhir wants his players to make their own history rather than follow anyone from the past including himself. Manjrekar didn't mince words when he said that the former southpaw hasn't strategically been on point in the red-ball format. Gavaskar firmly believes that team decisions must be made by the captain, independent of external influence, including that of the head coach. This special gathering saw players from both teams engage in a lively exchange of jerseys, skills, and camaraderie, delighting fans from both cricket and football around the world. Jadeja, with 661 runs and 31 wickets in 11 matches under Gambhir, has justified his position as an all-rounder with authority When asked specifically about vice-captain Pant's back-to-back centuries, Gambhir brushed off the praise.

KKR pacer Harshit and former captain Nitish Rana responded to the comments in strongly worded statements on social media. Live TV Share Advertisement Manoj Tiwary lashed out at Gautam Gambhir after India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (PTI File Photos) India Today Sports Desk New Delhi , UPDATED: Jan 9, 2025 17:38 IST Former India batter Manoj Tiwary has criticised Gautam Gambhir, calling the India head coach a hypocrite who \"doesn’t walk the talk\". Tiwary questioned Gambhir's appointment as head coach, claiming the former opener lacks clarity and a definitive coaching style. His strongly-worded remarks came in the wake of India’s loss in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and their failure to reach the World Test Championship final. advertisement Gautam Gambhir has faced intense scrutiny, along with captain Rohit Sharma and the leadership group, following India's 1-3 Test series defeat in Australia. Gambhir’s tenure as head coach has had a rocky start since he took over from Rahul Dravid, whose stint ended with a T20 World Cup triumph. Gambhir was given the freedom to select the support staff for the senior men’s team, bringing in former KKR mentor Abhishek Nayar, ex-South Africa pacer Morne Morkel, and former Netherlands batter Ryan ten Doeschate. Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Full Coverage Former cricketers and pundits, including the legendary Sunil Gavaskar, have questioned the effectiveness of Gambhir's coaching staff , particularly in addressing the batting unit’s consistent failures in Test cricket. India endured a historic 0-3 home Test series loss to New Zealand before their humbling defeat in Australia. \"Gautam Gambhir is a hypocrite. He doesn’t do what he says,\" Manoj Tiwary told News18 Bangla. \"What is the use of a bowling coach? Whatever the coach says, he will agree. Morne Morkel came from Lucknow Super Giants. Abhishek Nayar was at Kolkata Knight Riders with Gambhir, and the Indian head coach knows that he will not go against his instructions,\" Tiwary added. Tiwary also claimed he had foreseen dressing room rifts before the Australia tour began. The former Bengal captain alleged that captain Rohit Sharma and coach Gambhir are not on the same page, a disconnect he suggested was evident from the much-publicised dressing room leaks during the tour. He further accused Gambhir of taking undue credit for Kolkata Knight Riders' (KKR) successes in the IPL, both as captain and mentor, attributing these to effective PR rather than individual effort. “Gambhir didn’t guide KKR to the title single-handedly. We all performed as a unit. Jacques Kallis, Sunil Narine, and I, all contributed to the cause. But who took the credit? There is an environment and PR that allows him to take all the credit,\" Tiwary alleged. HARSHIT RANA, NITISH SLAM TIWARY CRITICISM, BACK GAMBHIR However, KKR fast bowler Harshit Rana and former captain Nitish Rana strongly refuted Tiwary’s claims, voicing their support for Gambhir. advertisement In an Instagram statement, Harshit said: \"Criticising someone due to personal insecurities is not good. Gauti bhaiya (brother) is someone who thinks more for others than himself. He always backs players when they are down and puts them in the limelight when things go our way. He has shown this on multiple occasions. He has a lot of knowledge on how to turn games in your favour.\" Nitish Rana shared similar sentiments: \"Criticism should be based on facts, not personal insecurities. Gauti bhaiya is one of the most selfless players I’ve ever met. He shoulders responsibility in times of distress like no other. Performance doesn’t need any PR. The trophies speak for themselves.\" Screengrab from Instagram Gambhir was widely credited for KKR’s IPL triumph in the 2024 season. The former India opener joined KKR as a mentor that year after working with the Lucknow Super Giants for two seasons. Before 2024, KKR had won IPL titles in 2012 and 2014 under Gambhir’s captaincy. Young players, including Harshit Rana, and seasoned professionals like Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy have credited Gambhir for helping them excel and play key roles in KKR’s successful 2024 campaign. Gambhir’s achievements as a mentor in the IPL over the last three seasons ultimately led to his appointment as India’s head coach. - Ends Published By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Jan 9, 2025 Must Watch Watch Live TV", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/gautam-gambhir-manoj-tiwary-hypocrite-explosive-interivew-kkr-harshit-rana-nitish-2662325-2025-01-09", "domain": "indiatoday.in", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 4650}, {"source_number": 11, "title": "Gambhir : A courageous cricketer who punched... - Rediff Cricket", "snippet": "But how does one judge cricketer Gambhir among the pantheons of greats in Indian cricket ?IMAGE: Gautam Gambhir had forged a formidable partnership with Delhi-teammate Virender Sehwag at the top of the order. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters.", "full_content": "His approach to the game was a complete dichotomy to his background, a rich kid, who had a fleet of chauffeur-driven cars waiting for him to be taken to practice. Grit that forced people to take notice, commitment that earned kudos, plain speak that raised eyebrows, Gautam Gambhir's eventful 15 years in Indian cricket were all these and many more. His cricketing epitaph was written when he was forced to(voluntarily, for his fans)step down after six failures in Indian Premier League, and Tuesday'semotional video postwas just an official closure on his part. But how does one judge cricketer Gambhir among the pantheons of greats in Indian cricket? Gambhir did not have the perfect technique that made Sunil Gavaskar the legend that he was. Neither did he possess the streak of genius that made Virender Sehwag one of Indian cricket's greatest entertainers. Yet, any Indian team between early 2008 till World Cup 2011 wasn't complete without the feisty left-hander from Rajinder Nagar in New Delhi. He was an incredible foil to Sehwag and despite his limited talent -- the ICC Test batsman of the Year for 2009 could always punch above his weight. But somehow, he remained the eternal bridesmaid to a Yuvraj Singh or a Mahendra Singh Dhoni, all his life. Top scorer in two World Cup finals (World T20 in 2007 and 2011 50-over WC final), he remained in the shadow of the talismanic Indian skipper Dhoni. The near 13 hour marathon innings against New Zealand at Napier (136) was an effort that connoisseurs of Test cricket will forever remember. Yet, strangely, Gambhir was more of a street fighter who would always be game for a good scrap, a complete contrast to the elegance of another left-handed great Sourav Ganguly. If Ganguly caressed the deliveries, Gambhir hammered them. Aesthetics wasn't Gambhir's best friend but he did befriend two serious qualities --temperament and courage -- required at the top level. His approach to the game was a complete dichotomy to his background, a rich kid, who had a fleet of chauffeur-driven cars waiting for him to be taken to practice. So, when he took on Shahid Afridi or Kamran Akmal during Indo-Pak One-Dayers or shoved Simon Katich during a Test match, it wasn't the rich kid Gambhir but the proverbial street fighter from West Delhi, who could blow his top at car parking areas. But it was Delhi cricket's inherent corruption that has always built resolute characters and Gambhir was one such. Even Indian cricket wasn't actually very fair to Gambhir, between 2003 to 2007, when he made sporadic India appearances. However, it was a century in the Ranji final against UP in 2007-08 with an injured palm (the skin was peeled and the pain was unbearable) paved his way back to the national team across all formats. There was no looking back for next four years as he forged a successful partnership with Sehwag. Things went downhill post the World Cup and a poor show in an aborted England trip was the beginning of the end. He was never the same international player again even though he captained the Kolkata Knight Riders to two IPL titles. Did he harbour captaincy ambitions? Of course he did, but that was MS Dhoni's peak time as a leader. By the time Dhoni started failing as Test captain, Gambhir's career in the longest version was as good as over. The four failures in the 2014 England series where he became a walking wicket in swinging conditions did dent his reputation. But ask any of his contemporaries about his prowess against spin bowling and the answer will be equivocal. There were only few who could dominate spinners like Gambhir did during his prime. If Ganguly's signature shot was straight loft or one over long on, Gambhir patented the inside out lofted shot, a difficult one to play. Off the field, he remained a man of strong likes and dislikes. There is no cricketer who is more opinionated than Gambhir and life for him is black or white. That's why he can't stand the sight of Ajay Jadeja or Manoj Prabhakar and he refused to play under their coaching since they were accused of match fixing. He was a pro-player and anti-establishment at the same time. He had no shame to take cudgels for youngsters against administrators or selectors his father's age. When he felt that KP Bhaskar was not treating youngsters fairly, he would charge towards him with a cricket bat accusing him of trying to ruin careers. Whether he was right or wrong will remain a subjective issue but unlike most of his contemporaries, he had an opinion and never failed to express it. Of late, he has not been shy of expressing his political thoughts on social media with varied response. The second innings of Gautam Gambhir is expected to be as eventful as his first whether it's in BCCI's board room or as a people's representative. He fears no one and he always speaks his mind.", "url": "https://www.rediff.com/cricket/report/gambhir-a-courageous-cricketer-who-punched-above-his-weight/20181205.htm", "domain": "rediff.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 4836}, {"source_number": 12, "title": "Cricbuzz Gautam Gambhir Profile - ICC Ranking, Age, Career Info & Stats | Cricbuzz.com", "snippet": "Gautam Gambhir's cricketing career ... and of course the proverbial acche din and bure din.

Gambhir's journey as a first-class cricketer began in the 1999-2000 season. But, it was a couple of years later, in 2002, that the Delhi lad first stole the spotlight. Then playing for the Board President's XI against a touring Zimbabwe team, the left-hander smashed a double century scoring 218 runs. A year later, came the big moment: Gambhir secured his place in the Indian team for the TVS Cup, a triangular fixture. Not as gifted as some of his contemporaries, initially Gambhir had to grin and bear it when selectors would just choose to overlook him. However, what separated him from the pack was his passion for the game and an almost insatiable appetite for runs. At the topmost level, the stakes are high. Bowlers keep an eye out for even the minutest of shortcomings in the best of batsmen. And Gambhir had a chink in his otherwise formidable armour: His front foot would fall over a bit, which often made him an easy LBW prey to quality fast bowlers. This flaw in the technique proved to be the recurrent glitch that kept his bat quiet between 2003 and 2006. Having fixed the fault, Gambhir was again in the reckoning, scoring enough to stake a claim for a place in India's 2007 ODI World Cup squad. But, the selectors thought otherwise. They preferred to instead go with hard-hitting right-hander Robin Uthappa, who had, under his belt, some match-winning knocks at the top of the order. The rejection severely jolted Gambhir, who even contemplated quitting the game. But, destiny had other plans in store for him. The same year in September, Gambhir was called back to open the batting with his Delhi mate Virender Sehwag for the T-20 World Cup. He grabbed the opportunity with both hands. In the high-voltage final against Pakistan, Gambhir showed nerves of steel scoring 75 runs that made all the difference. He was the second highest scorer in the tournament with 227 runs in the 7 innings. After that feat, Gambhir always enjoyed the backing of skipper MS Dhoni, but failed to break into the team. It was sheer hard luck, as legends of the game like Tendulkar still graced the Indian top-order. Gambhir was on the top of his game between 2008 and 2011. Always looking aggressive on the field, he hit the purple patch in those years scoring big and often match-winning knocks. In the 2008 CB series Down Under, Gambhir blazed a trail when he outscored the likes of Sachin, Ponting and Sangakara to emerge as the highest run-scorer of that ODI tri-series. Soon, Gambhir cemented his place in the ODI team, filling the big shoes of iconic left-hander Sourav Ganguly. The spectacular showing in the ODIs, earned him a place in the Test team, too. Having scored his first Test century against Bangladesh at Chittagong in 2004 , it took Gambhir almost four years to score his second test ton. But the third one came only nine days after. Of his 9 test centuries, the one he scored at Napier in New Zealand in 2009 will be remembered for long. Batting for a staggering 643 minutes, Gambhir showed grit deploying his stoic defence and scoring a match-saving 137 runs. By 2009, Gambhir had established himself as one of the top batsmen in International cricket. The same year, he received the prestigious ICC Test Cricketer of The Year award. Two years later, his decisive knock in the final of the 2011 ODI World Cup, which India won, made him a national hero of sorts. Post -2011 World Cup, many even saw Gambhir as next-in-line to MS Dhoni. But then came the slide in his fortunes. One bad series was followed by another, runs dried up and questions begun to be asked of his technique. In the 17 Test matches between 2011 and 2012, he averaged just 31. Eventually, he faced the axe.

Following a strong share price rally on Monday in his three group companies -- India's most valued firm Reliance Industries, Reliance Petroleum and Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd -- the net worth of Mukesh Ambani rose to $ 63.2 billion (Rs 2,49,108 crore). In comparison, the net worth of both Gates and Slim is estimated to be slightly lower at around $62.29 billion each, with Slim leading among the two by a narrow margin. Warren Buffett, earlier the third richest in the world, also dropped one position with a net worth of about $ 56 billion.Ambani's wealth of about Rs 2,49,000 crore includes about Rs 2,10,000 crore from RIL (50.98 per cent stake), Rs 37,500 crore from RPL (37.5 per cent) and Rs 2,100 crore from RIIL (46.23 per cent). Slim's wealth has been calculated on the basis of his stake in companies like America Movil (30 per cent), Carso Global (82 per cent), Grupo Carso (75 per cent), Inbursa (67 per cent), IDEAL (30 per cent) and Saks Inc (10 per cent). According to information available with the US and Mexican stock exchanges where these companies are listed, Slim currently holds shares worth a total of $ 62.2993 billion, with more than half coming from Latin American mobile major America Movil. Slim is closely followed by Gates with a net worth of $ 62.29 billion currently. Earlier last month, US business magazine Forbes had named Gates as the richest American with a net worth of $ 59 billion, calculated as on August 30. The magazine had said that a movement of two dollars in the share price for Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, could \"add or subtract a billion dollars\" from his wealth. Since August-end, Microsoft's share price has risen by $ 6.58 (based on Sunday's closing on Nasdaq at $ 35.03), which results into a gain of $ 3.29 billion in Gates' wealth based on Forbes assumption. Besides a stake in Microsoft, Gates' wealth also includes the commission and license fees earned by him and gains through his shares in an investment holding company that invests across the market. Gates is followed by Buffett at the fourth place in the league of the world's richest with a net worth of $ 55.9 billion through his holding in his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway and in other companies. At the end of August, Buffett's wealth stood at $ 52 billion, as per the Forbes magazine. Berkshire Hathaway's share price has gained by about 7.5 per cent since then. Earlier on September 26, Ambani had overtaken steel czar Lakshmi Mittal to become the richest Indian in the world. Mittal currently ranks as the fifth richest in the world with a net worth of $ 50.9 billion through his 44.79 per cent stake in world's biggest steel maker ArcelorMittal. While most of Mittal's wealth comes from his steel empire, though he has also spread his wings into businesses like oil and real estate, those of Ambani and Gates are mostly through petrochemicals and software respectively. However, Buffett and Slim are making money from investments across a host of sectors. Among the companies where Slim holds shares, Grupo Carso controls a diversified group of companies in Mexico including those in retail, industrial and consumer business. Carso Global Telecom is a Mexico-based holding company and has investments in domestic and foreign telecom, radio network and a satellite TV projects. America Movil is a leading wireless communications service provider in Latin America, Saks Inc is into the retail business and Grupo Financiero Inbursa is a Mexico-based financial services company with interests in investment funds, mortgages and commercial banking. Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en America Latina SA, also known as IDEAL, is into infrastructure development. These are the four richest people in the world with their net worth: 1. Mukesh Ambani (USD 63.2 billion)2. Carlos Slim Helu (USD 62.2993 billion)3. William (Bill) Gates (USD 62.29 billion)4.

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] Sometimes characterized as a plutocrat , [ 7 ] Ambani has attracted both fame and criticism for reports of market manipulation, political corruption, cronyism, and exploitation. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Early life Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden (present-day Yemen ) into a Gujarati Hindu family to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. His father was the founder and CEO of Reliance Industries, currently the largest public company in India by market capitalization. [ 12 ] He has a younger brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaonkar. [ 13 ] Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his father decided to move back to India in 1958 to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles. [ 14 ] The latter was originally named \"Vimal\" but later changed to \"Only Vimal\". [ 15 ] [ 16 ] His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar , Mumbai, until the 1970s. [ 17 ] The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society , used public transportation , and never received an allowance.

[ 23 ] His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company. [ 18 ] Ambani was influenced by his teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma because they are \"the kind of professors who made you think out of the box.\" [ 23 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Career Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (later Reliance Communications Limited ), which was focused on information and communications technology initiatives.

His first hit song as a playback singer was \"Dil Jalta Hai To Jalne De\" for actor Motilal in 1945 with the film Pehli Nazar with music composed by Anil Biswas and lyrics written by Aah Sitapuri. Mukesh was such a fan of singer K. L. Saigal that in his early years of playback singing he used to imitate his idol. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In fact, it is said that when K. L. Saigal first heard the song \"Dil Jalta Hai...\", he remarked, \"That's strange, I don't recall singing that song\". [ 9 ] Mukesh created his own singing style with the help of music director Naushad Ali , who helped Mukesh to come out of his Saigal style and create his own style. Naushad gave him songs for the film Andaz . Initially Mukesh was the ghost voice of Dilip Kumar in this movie and Mohammed Rafi sang for Raj Kapoor . He delivered many Hits for Naushad in films like: Anokhi Ada (1948), Mela (1948), Andaz (1949). Other composers who used Mukesh voice for great Dilip Kumar in hit songs like \"Jeevan Sapna toot gaya\" were Anil Biswas in Anokha Pyar, Ye Mera Diwanapan hai, Shankar–Jaikishan in Yahudi and Suhana Safar and Dil Tadap Tadap ke, Salil Choudhary in Madhumati. However, later Dilip Kumar choose Rafi as his ghost voice and Mukesh became the ghost voice of Raj Kapoor. Mukesh recorded highest number of songs for Shankar–Jaikishan, that is 133 songs followed by Kalyanji Anandji ie 99 songs. Out of 4 Filmfare Awards , Mukesh won 3 awards for Shankar–Jaikishan songs. In 1974, Mukesh received National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song \"Kai Baar Yuhi Dekha Hai\" from Rajnigandha (1974), and Filmfare Awards for the songs \"Sab Kuch Seekha Humne\" in the movie Anari (1959), \"Sabse Bada Naadan Wahi Hai\" in Pehchaan (1970), \"Jai Bolo Beimaan Ki\" in Beimaan (1972) (all the three songs composed by Shankar–Jaikishan) and \" Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein \", the title song of film Kabhie Kabhie (1976) (composed by Khayyam ). A total of around 1,300 songs were sung by him. This number is less than those sung by some of his contemporaries, but the fact is that Mukesh emphasised on quality rather than quantity. The comparatively fewer songs sung by him in the 1970s can be attributed to his failing health due to his worsening heart problem . [ citation needed ] Mukesh sang many songs for Kalyanji Anandji music director duo. Mukesh sang more songs with the K-A duo after Shankar–Jaikishan. From \"Naina hai jadoo bhare...\" Bedard Zamana Kya Jane (1958) composed by Kalyanji alone as Kalyanji Virji Shah, and \"Main hoon mast madari...\" Madari (1959) as the first Kalyanji-Anandji-Mukesh combo, to \"Chahe aaj mujhe napasand karo\" Darinda 1977, the K-A, Mukesh combination gave numerous popular songs like \"Chhalia mera naam...\", \"Mere toote hue dil se...\", \"Dum dum diga diga\" Chalia (1960), \"Mujhko iss raat ki tan", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_(singer)", "domain": "en.wikipedia.org", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 6, "title": "List of Top 10 Richest People in India 2025 - Jagran Josh", "snippet": "Aug 22, 2025 · Wealthiest person in the world : Discover the top 10 richest people in India for 2025, featuring Mukesh Ambani , Gautam Adani, and Shiv Nadar.", "full_content": "Comments All Comments ( 0 ) Join the conversation Sign in to comment for free!

Celebrated for his evocative voice and emotional depth, Mukesh …", "full_content": "Mukesh (singer) Mukesh’s Legacy Mukesh Chand Mathur, known to the world simply as Mukesh, was born on July 22, 1923, in Delhi, India. Over a career spanning more than three decades, Mukesh became one of the leading playback singers of Bollywood, widely recognized for his melancholic and soulful voice. He began his musical journey under the influence of K. L. Saigal, who was his ideal and source of inspiration. Despite a few initial struggles and setbacks, Mukesh’s undeniable talent and distinctive voice soon catapulted him to fame. His first major breakthrough came with the song “Dil Jalta Hai To Jalne De” from the 1945 film Pehli Nazar . This song marked him as a unique voice in the industry, different from the then-dominant style of playback singing. Critics and audiences alike praised Mukesh for his ability to convey profound emotions through his singing, which resonated deeply with listeners. His rise to stardom was further solidified with hits like “Awara Hoon” from the film Awaara (1951) and “Yeh Mera Deewanapan Hai” from Yahudi (1958). Mukesh’s impact on Indian cinema is evident in the sheer timelessness of his songs. His collaboration with legendary composers such as Shankar-Jaikishan, Naushad, and Salil Chowdhury yielded timeless classics that continue to be celebrated. He lent his voice to many iconic actors, most notably, Raj Kapoor, with whom he shared a particularly fruitful artistic relationship. Mukesh’s ability to infuse genuine emotion into his performances made his songs an integral part of these films and contributed significantly to their success. Throughout his career, Mukesh received numerous accolades, including several Filmfare Awards, which testified to his immense talent and enduring legacy. Even after his demise in 1976, his music remains a cornerstone of Bollywood’s musical heritage, influencing generations of singers and music lovers alike. Early Life and Musical Beginnings Mukesh Chand Mathur, known to the world simply as Mukesh, was born on July 22, 1923, in Delhi, India. Growing up in a middle-class family, Mukesh’s early years were marked by cultural richness and an inherent love for music, elements that would play pivotal roles in shaping his future career. His family’s modest lifestyle did not afford many luxuries, but it did provide an environment where the arts were greatly appreciated. Mukesh’s father, Zorawar Chand Mathur, worked as an engineer, while his mother, Chandrani Mathur, nurtured the household with traditional values. Despite no professional musical training in the family, Mukesh found inspiration from early exposure to regional and classical Indian music. His passion for singing was evident even as a child, as he often took part in community gatherings and school competitions, where his voice began to attract notice. The formative years were not without challenges. Initial efforts to break into the music industry were met with obstacles, exacerbated by the lack of a structured path to becoming a playback singer at the time. However, Mukesh’s perseverance was undeterred. It was at a family wedding where he first drew the attention of the renowned actor and producer Motilal, a distant relative. Recognizing his nephew’s potential, Motilal took Mukesh under his wing, becoming an influential mentor in his nascent career. Through Motilal’s guidance and connections, Mukesh moved to Mumbai, where he began to train rigorously, refining his vocal skills. It was during this period that he secured his first opportunity to sing in a film. His debut song “Dil Hi Bujha Hua Ho To” in the movie Nirdosh (1941) was a modest success, but it marked the beginning of a storied career. Subsequent collaboration with the iconic composer Naushad further elevated Mukesh’s standing, as they worked together on several landmark projects. These early experiences laid the foundation for Mukesh’s unique singing style, characterized by a deep resonance and emotive quality that would come to define his contributions to Bollywood music. It was the beginning of a journey that would see Mukesh rise to become one of the most revered playback singers in Indian cinema. The Unmistakable Voice of Sadness and Romance Mukesh’s voice has long been synonymous with melancholy and romance in Bollywood’s golden era. His unique vocal qualities set him apart, making him the go-to singer for songs that needed a touch of emotional depth and poignancy. Mukesh possessed an innate ability to convey deep emotions, delivering each note with an authenticity that resonated profoundly with listeners. Unlike his contemporaries, such as Kishore Kumar, whose versatility allowed him to excel in a variety of genres, or Mohammad Rafi, who was celebrated for his vocal range and technical prowess, Mukesh excelled in imparting a touching sense of wistfulness and sorrow. One of the key factors that contributed to Mukesh’s enduring appeal was his ability to maintain a sense of simplicity and sincerity in his singing.

Before beginning his career as a singer, he worked as a clerk in Department of Public Works in Delhi. His father-in-law was against the marriage of his daughter with a singer. Therefore, Mukesh has decided to elope with his wife Saral and started living together in Mumbai. Famous actor Motilal, a distant relative of Mukesh, observed his singing in an event and arranged the tutelage for him under Pandit Jagannath Prasad in Mumbai. He was an ardent fan of K. L. Saigal and used to imitate his voice at the early stage of his singing career. It is said that when K. L. Saigal first heard the song “Dil Jalta Hai,” he was not able to recognise that whether he sang that song or someone else. He sang for various films of Raj Kapoor and became the favourite voice of the legendary actor. His famous classic songs for Raj Kapoor includes Kisi Ki Muskurahaton Pe Ho Nisar (Anari, 1959), Awara Hoon (Awaara, 1951), Jaane Kahan Gaye Woh Din (Mera Naam Joker, 1970), and many more. Music directors like Naushad and Anil Biswas helped him in developing his own style of singing by giving him songs of different genres like Mera Pyaar Bhi Tu Hain Yeh, Uthaye Ja Unke Sitam Aur Jiye Ja, Ham Aj Kahin Dil Kho Baithe, and many more. His name along with Mohammed Rafi and Kishore Kumar is counted among the leading playback singers of their time. He worked with various renowned music directors such as S.D. Burman, Kalyanji Anandji, Shankar Jaikishen, Laxmikant Pyarelal, and many more. One of his songs ‘Jeena Yahan Marna Yahan,’ directed by Shankar Jaikishan, has always been the favourite song for all the music lovers. He was accoladed with the National Award for the song ‘Kai Baar Yun Bhi Dekha’, and honoured with four Filmfare Awards for the songs ‘Sab Kuch Seekha’ (1959), ‘Jai Bolo Beimaan Ki’ (1972), ‘Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein’ (1976), and ‘Sabse Bada Naadan’ (1970). He was also honoured with Bengal Film Journalists Association Awards for his songs ‘Duniya Banane Wale,’ ‘Chandan Sa Badan’, and ‘Ram Kare Aisa Ho Jaye.’ On 27 August 1976, he went to Detroit, Michigan for a concert with Lata Mangeshkar but after taking shower in the early morning, he complained about his chest pain and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The rest of the concert was completed by Lata Mangeshkar and his son Nitin Mukesh. His songs such as ‘Ham Dono Milke Kagaz Pe’, ‘Humko Tumse Ho Gayaa Hai Pyaar,’ and ‘Saat Ajoobe Is Duniya Ke’, were released after his death.

Mukesh was born as Zoraver Chand Mathur in Delhi on July 22nd, 1923. His name is mentioned with the names of great legends like Mohammed Rafi and Kishore Kumar. Mukesh left studies after the 10th standard and got a job with Delhi Department of Public Works. He experimented with voice recordings and at the same time, honed his singing ability. A short biography covering the life history of Mukesh has been given below. The singer in Mukesh was recognized by the renowned actor Motilal, who happened to be a distant relative of Mukesh. He saw Mukesh perform at the wedding of his sister and recognized a hidden spark in the young boy. Mukesh was taken to Bombay where he received training in music to refine his voice. In this period he even managed to bag a role in a Hindi movie titled Nirdosh (1941), which unfortunately did not fare well at the box office. His first stint as a playback singer was in the movie Pehli Nazar (1945). The song incidentally was picturized on Motilal. Mukesh had the voice that could paint a thousand shades of melancholy. The way he sang, with the perfect tone and diction, he was considered as second to none. The pain that he had in his voice could not be imitated by anyone else. One could feel the tenderness and joy with doses of hidden anguish in his voice that was presented in a raw manner. He went on to command a huge fan following and was counted as a legend among legends. The music maestro Salil Choudhury praised Mukesh with following quote: \"Each word from his lips was a pearl. No one could sing the way Mukesh did, with the right diction, inflexion and intonation. His vocal timbre was out of this world.\" Mukesh finally discovered his own style with the films Mela (1948) and Andaaz (1949). With music director Naushad, Mukesh belted out some unforgettable hits like Tu Kahe Agar, Jhoom Jhoom ke Naacho Aaj, Hum Aaj Kahin Dil Kho Baithe, Toote Na Dil Toote Na. These four solos made him a well-known playback singer overnight. It was in the year 1948 that Mukesh sang for Raj Kapoor for the movie Aag. The voice of Mukesh perfectly matched the helplessness that was portrayed onscreen by Raj Kapoor in the song Zinda Hoon Is Tarah. After that there was no looking back and this wonderful partnership went on till the year 1975. With Raj Kapoor, Mukesh immortalized heartbreaks and despair and belted out some classic numbers and endless list of hits. The ones that deserve a mention are Awaara (1951), Shri 420 (1955), Parvarish (1958), Anari (1959), Sangam (1964), Mera Naam Joker (1970) and Kabhi Kabhi (1976). His last recording with Raj Kapoor was the song \"Ek Din Bik Jaayega\" from the movie Dharam Karam. The music was composed by R.D. Burman. Mukesh breathed his last while on a concert tour to Detroit, U.S. He suffered a massive heart attack. His untimely death shocked the entire nation and the film industry. When the news of his death reached the film industry, Raj Kapoor said, \"I have lost my voice\". Such was the fame of Mukesh who shall truly remain a legend.

They say “crony capitalism” in India has helped certain corporations, such as Ambani’s, thrive. open image in gallery Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman of Reliance Industries, Radhika Merchant and Nita Ambani, share a moment during the pre-wedding celebrations of Anant Ambani and Radhika in Jamnagar, Gujarat, India ( via REUTERS ) The family patriarch has started passing the torch to his two sons and daughter.

However, his position was unique - while Rafi was perfection incarnate and Kumar was the astonishing yodeller, Mukesh was that man in a bar who would pour you a drink and would sing you a song for friendships' sake. His voice held a haunting, melancholic quality that could reach into your soul and move you to tears. He was born Mukesh Chand Mathur on 22 July 1923, into a small middle-class family living in Delhi. He was first heard noticed by an actor and distant relative, Motilal, when he sang a song at his sister's wedding. Deeply impressed, Motilal brought him to his own house in Bombay and had him groomed by the noted singer Pandit Jaganath Prasad. During this time Mukesh tried his hand at acting, but his first acting film, Nirdosh (1942) , was a flop. However, he got his big break as a singer with Pahali Nazar (1945) - picturised on Motilal, the song became a success. Initially, his voice did seem to be imitating K.L. Saigal, but he acquired his own style in Gesture (1949) . The film, a passionate love triangle, became a runaway hit and so did all of its songs, especially the Mukesh solos. As well as launching Mukesh's career, it created an association with the renowned Raj Kapoor that would last throughout their lives. Starting with Aag (1948) all the way through to Dharam Karam (1975) , Mukesh sang for Raj Kapoor and together they produced some of the greatest film songs in Bollywood history, most notably in Awaara (1951) , Shree 420 (1955) , _Anadi (1959)_, _Sangam (1964)_ and Mera Naam Joker (1970) . Life was not always that good, however. Encouraged by his success as a singer, he made a few more attempts to make it as an star, and acted in two films - Mashooka (1953) and Anuraag (1956) . They sadly sank at the box-office. To make matters worse, when he returned to singing he found that offers had dried up, and his financial affairs became that, unable to afford their school fees, his two children were thrown out of school! Fortunately, he came back with a bang in Yahudi (1958) , and two other hits from 1958 - Madhumati (1958) and Parvarish (1958) - put him back on top as a singer to be reckoned with. Even Sachin Dev Burman, who had not used him for a decade, composed two classic songs for him from the films _Bambai ka Babu (1960)_ and Bandini (1963) . He flourished throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with soulful hit songs, most notably from Anand (1971) , a classic about a dying man; Rajnigandha (1974) , a middle-class love story; and Kabhie Kabhie (1976) , a cross-generation romance. In 27 August 1976, while on a concert tour in the USA, Mukesh suffered a sudden, sharp and fatal heart attack in Detroit. Afterwards, several recorded songs of his came out in films released after his death, the last being for Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978) , a Raj Kapoor film. He left behind a void that many male singers, including his own son Nitin Mukesh, have tried to fill, but no one has managed to fill the place of such a great singer. Mukesh was, is and will be the only Bollywood singer to possess a golden voice...

The Mumbai-based conglomerate's other businesses include polymer and chemical manufacturers, and the group had revenue of $114 billion in the year to March 2025. The billionaire also owns the Mumbai Indians cricket team. The majority of Ambani's wealth derives from a 42% stake in publicly traded Reliance Industries. The Mumbai-based company has the largest oil refining complex in the world, according to its website. The shares are held by a promoter group, which includes holding companies, trusts and family members, according to a June 2025 filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange. They're all credited in this analysis to Ambani to reflect his status as founder, chairman and managing director. A stake held by his mother is excluded. Jio Financials Services was spun-out of Reliance Industries on July 20, 2023 on a 1:1 distribution to shareholders. He owns about 43% of the company directly and through a promoter group, according to a June 2025 filing. The billionaire's Mumbai mansion, Antilia, was valued at more than $400 million in a 2014 analysis by property surveyors. Media reports say Ambani has spent more than $1 billion on the 27-story property. The valuation used here reflects the lower amount because of uncertainty around funding costs and re-sale value. He has collected around $3.5 billion in dividends, according to Bloomberg data. The value of his cash investments is based on an analysis of those proceeds, share transactions, as well as taxes, market performance and family investments. Tushar Pania, a spokesman at Reliance Industries, declined to comment on the valuation of his personal assets and the calculation of his net worth. Father Dhirubhai Ambani got his start as a clerk at the trading company A. Besse & Co. in Aden, Turkey. He struck out on his own in 1958 trading spices and yarn with Yemen and eventually built Reliance Industries into a fabrics, textiles and energy empire. The company, which began trading in India in 1977, often had its annual meetings in stadiums. Mukesh Ambani moved to Palo Alto, California, in 1979, to attend Stanford Business School. He was summoned home a year later by his father to oversee construction of a polyester mill. The Ambanis began to buy up suppliers as well as petrochemical plants and oil refineries. Dhirubhai died of a stroke in 2002 without leaving a will, causing a fraternal feud between Mukesh and brother Anil. Three years later, in a settlement brokered by their mother, the brothers split the family business. Mukesh retained control over refining, petrochemicals, oil and gas and textiles operations, while Anil took the telecommunications, asset management, entertainment and power generation businesses. The duo settled a legal dispute over sharing natural gas and dissolved the noncompete pacts in 2010. Three years later, the brothers announced a $220 million pact to share a fiber-optic network, their first deal since splitting the Reliance business empire. Mukesh told shareholders in June 2014 his company plans to start a $12 billion telecommunications network. Mukesh built a 27-story mansion in Mumbai that holds six residents: Ambani, his wife, three children and his mother. The 48,000-square-foot building has room for 600 servants, three rooftop helipads, parking for 168 cars on six floors, a 50-seat movie theater, a grand ballroom with crystal chandeliers, three floors of Babylon-inspired hanging gardens, a yoga studio and a health spa and fitness center. Methodology:The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world's richest people. In calculating net worth, Bloomberg News strives to provide the most transparent calculations available, and each individual billionaire profile contains a detailed analysis of how that person's fortune is tallied. The index is a dynamic measure of personal wealth based on changes in markets, the economy and Bloomberg reporting. Each net worth figure is updated every business day after the close of trading in New York. Stakes in publicly traded companies are valued using the share's most recent closing price.

Elon Musk has reclaimed his title as the world’s richest person for the fourth time in five years as his net worth surged by 82%, or $189 billion driven by a surge in Tesla share price post Trump election. He is followed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos with a net worth that surged by 44% or $81 billion. Other major gainers are Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Dell’s Michael Dell and Alphabet’s Larry Page. In India, Mukesh Ambani slipped out of the top 10 in the world’s rich list but remains the richest person in Asia with a net worth of ₹8.6 lakh crore ($100 billion). Gautam Adani is just behind Mr. Ambani with a rise in fortune by 13% and a net worth of ₹8.4 lakh crore ($97 billion). HCL Technologies’ chairperson Roshni Nadar is the new entrant on the list and has become the first Indian woman to break into the world’s richest persons list. She has a net worth of ₹3.5 lakh crore ($40 billion) and also became the fifth richest woman globally after her father transferred a 47% stake in HCL to her. Interestingly, amid the concerns on the concentration of wealth in a few hands, the list pointed out that India has surpassed China in the average wealth of every billionaire. From a city perspective, Mumbai added 11 billionaires to take the total up to 90 such super-rich people, but lost the tag of being Asia’s billionaire capital to Shanghai this year. The list said that 175 Indian billionaires have seen a rise in wealth over the past year, while 109 saw their networth decline or remain the same.

Ambanis hit $100-bn mark", "full_content": "NEW DELHI: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani on Monday became the richest person in the world, surpassing American software czar Bill Gates, Mexican business tycoon Carlos Slim Helu and famous investment guru Warren Buffett, courtesy the bull run in the stock market. Following a strong share price rally on in his three group companie, India's most valued firm Reliance Industries, Reliance Petroleum and Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd, the net worth of Mukesh Ambani rose to $63.2 billion (Rs 2,49,108 crore). In comparison, the net worth of both Gates and Slim is estimated to be slightly lower at around $62.29 billion each, with Slim leading among the two by a narrow margin. Warren Buffett, earlier the third richest in the world, also dropped one position with a net worth of about $56 billion. Ambani's wealth of about Rs 2,49,000 crore includes about Rs 2,10,000 crore from RIL (50.98 per cent stake), Rs 37,500 crore from RPL (37.5 per cent) and Rs 2,100 crore from RIIL (46.23 per cent). Slim's wealth has been calculated on the basis of his stake in companies like America Movil (30 per cent), Carso Global (82 per cent), Grupo Carso (75 per cent), Inbursa (67 per cent), IDEAL (30 per cent) and Saks Inc (10 per cent). According to information available with the US and Mexican stock exchanges where these companies are listed, Slim currently holds shares worth a total of $62.2993 billion, with more than half coming from Latin American mobile major America Movil. Slim is closely followed by Gates with a net worth of $62.29 billion currently. Earlier last month, US business magazine Forbes had named Gates as the richest American with a net worth of $59 billion, calculated as on August 30. The magazine had said that a movement of two dollars in the share price for Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, could \"add or subtract a billion dollars\" from his wealth. Since August-end, Microsoft's share price has risen by $6.58 (based on yesterday's closing on Nasdaq at $35.03), which results into a gain of $3.29 billion in Gates' wealth based on Forbes assumption. Besides a stake in Microsoft, Gates' wealth also includes the commission and license fees earned by him and gains through his shares in an investment holding company that invests across the market. Gates is followed by Buffett at the fourth place in the league of the world's richest with a net worth of $55.9 billion through his holding in his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway and in other companies. At the end of August, Buffett's wealth stood at $52 billion, as per the Forbes magazine. Berkshire Hathaway's share price has gained by about 7.5 per cent since then. Earlier on September 26, Ambani had overtaken steel czar Lakshmi Mittal to become the richest Indian in the world. Live Events Mittal currently ranks as the fifth richest in the world with a net worth of $50.9 billion through his 44.79 per cent stake in world's biggest steel maker ArcelorMittal. While most of Mittal's wealth comes from his steel empire, though he has also spread his wings into businesses like oil and real estate, those of Ambani and Gates are mostly through petrochemicals and software respectively. However, Buffett and Slim are making money from investments across a host of sectors. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

With a net worth of $119.5 billion as of October 9, 2024, Ambani is Asia’s wealthiest person. He ranked among the top 10 wealthiest people in the world on Forbes magazine’s annual list of billionaires in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Ambani is one of four children of renowned Indian industrialist Dhirubhai Ambani , who first worked as a gas station attendant in Aden , Yemen . Because of the increasingly unstable political climate in Aden, where Mukesh Ambani was born, the family relocated in 1958 to the Bhuleshwar neighborhood of Bombay (now Mumbai ), where they lived in a chawl (a communal building that commonly features low-rent two-room apartments). That same year Dhirubhai Ambani and a cousin founded the Reliance Commercial Corporation, which grew into RIL from a commodities-trading business that they initially operated out of a one-room rental space. Education and early professional life Mukesh Ambani earned a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the University of Bombay (now the University of Mumbai ) and subsequently pursued a master’s degree in business administration from Stanford University . However, he left the program in 1981 to join the family business, where he worked to diversify the company, venturing into a vast array of areas, including communications, infrastructure, petrochemicals , petroleum refining , polyester fibers, and gas and oil production. Britannica Quiz Explore India Quiz The Ambani brothers’ feuds Following Dhirubhai Ambani’s death in 2002, Mukesh Ambani and his brother, Anil Ambani , assumed joint leadership of the Reliance companies. However, the brothers’ feuds over control prompted their mother, Kokilaben Ambani, to split Reliance’s assets via a noncompetition agreement (2006–10) under which Mukesh Ambani assumed control of the gas, oil, and petrochemicals units as RIL under the umbrella of the Reliance Group. Anil Ambani gained control of the telecommunications, power generation, and financial services. Expansion of RIL Mukesh Ambani has been credited with commissioning the globe’s largest start-up petroleum refinery at Jamnagar , Gujarat state, in 1999, as well as spearheading the creation of several state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities that vastly increased RIL’s production capabilities. Another refinery was added close to the first Jamnagar refinery in 2008. Two years earlier Ambani led the development of Reliance Retail—a retail network comprising both physical and online stores, claimed by Reliance to be India’s largest retailer. Reliance Retail’s customer base reached 249 million in the 2023 fiscal year . Ambani’s multiple business successes include the purchase of the Mumbai Indians , an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team, through a Reliance subsidiary in 2008. The Mumbai Indians were the only IPL team to grow in brand value in 2020 despite empty stadiums in a pandemic-hit world. It retained its position as the most valuable IPL brand in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2010 the two Reliance groups owned by Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani mutually scrapped the noncompetition agreement signed in 2006, and later that decade Mukesh Ambani established Jio Platforms, a subsidiary of RIL dedicated to telecommunications and e-commerce .

Investors are concerned about rising debt and his fortune which stood at $120.8 billion in July — when son Anant got married, has now reduced to $96.7 billion as of December 13, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index (BBI). For Adani, the troubles are more deeper. His conglomerate is facing threat from a United States Department of Justice (DoJ)probethat could freeze any momentum as uncertainity extends. The investigation announced in November pulled Adani's net worth from $122.3 billion in June to $82.1 billion now, as per the BBI. Further for Adani, hits from theHindenburgResearch report while alleged fraud have been heavy. As such, Bloomberg reported that both Adani andAmbaniare out of its “elite centibillionaires club”, comprising those with wealth exceeding $100 billion.

However, there was a time when RIL boss became the world’s richest surpassing Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. It was in October 2007, when the oil tycoon topped the global rich list surpassing tech czar Bill Gates, Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim Helu and billionaire investor Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway. Valued at $63.2 billion in 2007, Ambani’s wealth surged more than $25 billion in 13 years.

At the same time, Ambanis emerged as the first family in India to hold $100 billion in stock market wealth with Anil Ambani, then valued at $38.5 billion on back of a sharp surge in stock prices. Their combined wealth was pegged to be more than Walton family of US which owns retail giant Wal-Mart.

Following a strong share price rally on Monday in his three group companies -- India's most valued firm Reliance Industries, Reliance Petroleum and Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd -- the net worth of Mukesh Ambani rose to $ 63.2 billion (Rs 2,49,108 crore). In comparison, the net worth of both Gates and Slim is estimated to be slightly lower at around $62.29 billion each, with Slim leading among the two by a narrow margin. Warren Buffett, earlier the third richest in the world, also dropped one position with a net worth of about $ 56 billion.Ambani's wealth of about Rs 2,49,000 crore includes about Rs 2,10,000 crore from RIL (50.98 per cent stake), Rs 37,500 crore from RPL (37.5 per cent) and Rs 2,100 crore from RIIL (46.23 per cent). Slim's wealth has been calculated on the basis of his stake in companies like America Movil (30 per cent), Carso Global (82 per cent), Grupo Carso (75 per cent), Inbursa (67 per cent), IDEAL (30 per cent) and Saks Inc (10 per cent). According to information available with the US and Mexican stock exchanges where these companies are listed, Slim currently holds shares worth a total of $ 62.2993 billion, with more than half coming from Latin American mobile major America Movil. Slim is closely followed by Gates with a net worth of $ 62.29 billion currently. Earlier last month, US business magazine Forbes had named Gates as the richest American with a net worth of $ 59 billion, calculated as on August 30. The magazine had said that a movement of two dollars in the share price for Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, could \"add or subtract a billion dollars\" from his wealth. Since August-end, Microsoft's share price has risen by $ 6.58 (based on Sunday's closing on Nasdaq at $ 35.03), which results into a gain of $ 3.29 billion in Gates' wealth based on Forbes assumption. Besides a stake in Microsoft, Gates' wealth also includes the commission and license fees earned by him and gains through his shares in an investment holding company that invests across the market. Gates is followed by Buffett at the fourth place in the league of the world's richest with a net worth of $ 55.9 billion through his holding in his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway and in other companies. At the end of August, Buffett's wealth stood at $ 52 billion, as per the Forbes magazine. Berkshire Hathaway's share price has gained by about 7.5 per cent since then. Earlier on September 26, Ambani had overtaken steel czar Lakshmi Mittal to become the richest Indian in the world. Mittal currently ranks as the fifth richest in the world with a net worth of $ 50.9 billion through his 44.79 per cent stake in world's biggest steel maker ArcelorMittal. While most of Mittal's wealth comes from his steel empire, though he has also spread his wings into businesses like oil and real estate, those of Ambani and Gates are mostly through petrochemicals and software respectively. However, Buffett and Slim are making money from investments across a host of sectors. Among the companies where Slim holds shares, Grupo Carso controls a diversified group of companies in Mexico including those in retail, industrial and consumer business. Carso Global Telecom is a Mexico-based holding company and has investments in domestic and foreign telecom, radio network and a satellite TV projects. America Movil is a leading wireless communications service provider in Latin America, Saks Inc is into the retail business and Grupo Financiero Inbursa is a Mexico-based financial services company with interests in investment funds, mortgages and commercial banking. Impulsora del Desarrollo y el Empleo en America Latina SA, also known as IDEAL, is into infrastructure development. These are the four richest people in the world with their net worth: 1. Mukesh Ambani (USD 63.2 billion)2. Carlos Slim Helu (USD 62.2993 billion)3. William (Bill) Gates (USD 62.29 billion)4.

The celebrations of Anant Ambani marrying Radhika Merchant took place at the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai and the family home. The marriage culminated months of wedding events that featured performances by pop stars including Rihanna and Justin Bieber . The four-day wedding celebrations began Friday with the traditional Hindu wedding ceremony and will be followed by a grand reception to run through the weekend.

Cena came in a sky-blue sherwani and white pants. Nick Jonas wore a pink sherwani and white pants. Police imposed traffic diversions around the wedding venue from Friday to Monday to handle the influx of guests who flew to Mumbai, where heavy monsoon rains have caused flooding and flight disruptions for the past week. The extravaganza and the display of opulence that comes with the wedding has led many to raise questions about rising inequality in India, where the gap between rich and poor is growing. The event has also sparked anger among some Mumbai residents, who say they are struggling with snarled traffic. “It affects our earnings. I don’t care much about the wedding,” said Vikram, a taxi driver who uses only one name.

Following a strong share price rally on in his three group companie, India's most valued firm Reliance Industries, Reliance Petroleum and Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd, the net worth of Mukesh Ambani rose to $63.2 billion (Rs 2,49,108 crore). In comparison, the net worth of both Gates and Slim is estimated to be slightly lower at around $62.29 billion each, with Slim leading among the two by a narrow margin. Warren Buffett, earlier the third richest in the world, also dropped one position with a net worth of about $56 billion. Ambani's wealth of about Rs 2,49,000 crore includes about Rs 2,10,000 crore from RIL (50.98 per cent stake), Rs 37,500 crore from RPL (37.5 per cent) and Rs 2,100 crore from RIIL (46.23 per cent). Slim's wealth has been calculated on the basis of his stake in companies like America Movil (30 per cent), Carso Global (82 per cent), Grupo Carso (75 per cent), Inbursa (67 per cent), IDEAL (30 per cent) and Saks Inc (10 per cent). According to information available with the US and Mexican stock exchanges where these companies are listed, Slim currently holds shares worth a total of $62.2993 billion, with more than half coming from Latin American mobile major America Movil. Slim is closely followed by Gates with a net worth of $62.29 billion currently. Earlier last month, US business magazine Forbes had named Gates as the richest American with a net worth of $59 billion, calculated as on August 30. The magazine had said that a movement of two dollars in the share price for Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, could \"add or subtract a billion dollars\" from his wealth. Since August-end, Microsoft's share price has risen by $6.58 (based on yesterday's closing on Nasdaq at $35.03), which results into a gain of $3.29 billion in Gates' wealth based on Forbes assumption. Besides a stake in Microsoft, Gates' wealth also includes the commission and license fees earned by him and gains through his shares in an investment holding company that invests across the market. Gates is followed by Buffett at the fourth place in the league of the world's richest with a net worth of $55.9 billion through his holding in his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway and in other companies. At the end of August, Buffett's wealth stood at $52 billion, as per the Forbes magazine. Berkshire Hathaway's share price has gained by about 7.5 per cent since then. Earlier on September 26, Ambani had overtaken steel czar Lakshmi Mittal to become the richest Indian in the world. Live Events Mittal currently ranks as the fifth richest in the world with a net worth of $50.9 billion through his 44.79 per cent stake in world's biggest steel maker ArcelorMittal. While most of Mittal's wealth comes from his steel empire, though he has also spread his wings into businesses like oil and real estate, those of Ambani and Gates are mostly through petrochemicals and software respectively. However, Buffett and Slim are making money from investments across a host of sectors. Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

Once among world’s 4th richest, Anil Ambani is now struggling to pay dues of his debt-laden companies. Earlier this year, his legal team argued that his net worth is zero and Ambani family won’t come to his aid. The court was hearing claims by Chinese banks –Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd Mumbai Branch, China Development Bank and Exim Bank of China –that the younger Ambani owes them $680 billion in dues after an alleged breach of personal guarantee on a debt refinancing loan of around $925 billion. The UK court did not buy the argument of Ambani’s legal team, headed by Harish Salve, that the billionaire’s worth, taking into account his liabilities, has turned to zero in a matter of years. The plaintiffs’ legal team brought into question Anil Ambani’s fleet of cars reportedly worth $3.2 million, private jet and helicopter that he gifted to his wife Tina Ambani, and even his two-floor house in Mumbai’s Sea Wind building at Cuffe Parade. Ambani argued that these assets were owned by corporate entities and are therefore are not part of his personal possessions. “Whereas Mr. Anil Ambani’s investments were worth more than $7 billion in 2012, they are now worth $89 million, and his net worth is zero once his liabilities are taken into account… Quite simply, he was a wealthy businessman, now he is not,” said his barrister Robert Howe. His legal team argued that their client’s financial standing took a big blow in 2012 owing to a downturn in India’s telecom sector where his company and Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) crown jewel Reliance Communications. Anil Ambani claimed he had a personal deficit of $305 million and that his net worth collapsed from $7 billion in March 2012 to zero in December 2019. A bitter feud broke between Anil Ambani and his elder sibling Mukesh Ambani to take control of their father’s business empire spanning over various industrial sectors and comprising many companies when the latter died in 2002. The brightest and best assets including the new-age telecom business as well as the financial service and energy and infra arms went to Anil Ambani while Mukesh Ambani got the oil & gas, petrochemical, refining and manufacturing assets. While the elder Ambani went on to become World’s richest, the younger sibling became a case study in how to lose a billion-dollar empire. In 2008, Anil Ambani was named the sixth-richest person in the world by Forbes which pegged his wealth at $42 billion. In a mere 12 years, according to Ambani’s own admission, it was reduced to net worth to zero. So, what went wrong for Anil Ambani? According to analysts, the younger Ambani wanted ADAG to be the biggest player in telecom, power and infrastructure. This fast-paced, debt-fuelled ambition to juggle too many balls at once is what landed him in trouble. Lawsuits failed deals, and mismanagement of companies are other reasons which accelerated the pace of ADAG’s crash. In 2018, AGAG group companies’ debt stood at Rs 1.72 lakh crore and in 2019, Reliance Communications had a debt of Rs 46,000 crore and was headed for bankruptcy proceedings. Its revenue crashed to Rs 1,734 crore in FY20 from Rs 27,710 crore in FY10. Other group companies also went down a similar trajectory. How Mukesh Ambani become world’s 4th richest Person now.

A teacher and former governor of Jharkhand State, she is the first person from a tribal community to serve as India's head of state. She is a member of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but can play a significant role if, for example, no party wins an outright majority in elections. Prime Minister: Narendra Modi Image source, Getty Images Bharatiya Janata Party leader Narendra Modi was elected for a third term as India's prime minister in June 2024. Mr Modi's BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won the general election with 293 seats, a much lower margin than predicted by exit polls. The election saw a resurgence of India's opposition, which won 234 seats. Mr Modi is only the second Indian leader to win a third consecutive term after the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Polls had projected outright victory for his Hindu Nationalist BJP party, which has ruled India for a decade, but it lost its parliamentary majority and Mr Modi's bloc relied on two key allies, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Janata Dal (United) JD(U), to cross the 272-seat mark needed to form the government. During the election, critics accused Mr Modi and his party of using hate speech, attacking the country's Muslim minority, and jailing opposition figures. Following the election result, Mr Modi said his alliance was \"committed to the principle of \"sarva panth sambhava\" (religious equality). KASHMIR The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part. Today it remains one of the most militarised zones in the world. China administers parts of the territory.

These discussions were based on the new estimates of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of various countries for 2024 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and its annual projections from 2025 till 2030. As per these projections, India’s GDP in 2025 was likely to be $4,187.03 billion, which will be marginally higher than the GDP of Japan at $4,186.43 billion. Thus, in all probability, India will be the fourth largest economy of the world in 2025 after the U.S., China and Germany. These discussions have stirred the political pot as well. Government sources attributed the improved rank to the leadership capabilities of the Prime Minister. It was also argued that India could grow to be the third largest economy of the world in 2028, and a high-income, developed country (viksit bharat) by 2047. The GDP of a country tells us very little about how its people live and work, how healthy or educated its people are, and how unequally its aggregate income is distributed. GDP estimates also miss out on measuring several crucial aspects of economic activity that are not covered by markets, such as the unpaid work of women. Hence, there have been repeated calls to revise national account systems, end the predominant use of GDP to assess everything, and use other indicators that allow us to study socio-economic achievements better. Yet, the dominant use of GDP has continued in global and domestic discourse. In recent years, the politicisation of statistical systems has clouded any objective assessment of India’s economic status. The discussions around India’s rank in GDP size are just an example. Comparison of GDP sizes across countries is a complex effort. International organisations and economists have spent decades trying to perfect a robust methodology for these comparisons. Consequently, there is no single GDP estimate for countries. There are several GDP estimates based on different methodologies and units. The methodology of estimating GDP in different countries is largely standardised even as there are variations in the quality of data collection. But these estimates are available only in the national currencies of each country. So, how does one compare the GDP size of India and, say, the U.S.? To compare, one needs the GDP estimates of all countries to be in one common unit. This common unit is the U.S. dollar. But problems remain. There are two ways of converting a GDP estimate in a national currency to a GDP estimate in U.S. dollars. First, one may use market exchange rates from the foreign exchange markets. At the time of writing this article, one dollar was valued at ₹85.69. One may simply divide India’s nominal GDP by ₹85.69 to get a GDP estimate in U.S. dollars, and then repeat that for all other countries and rank them. According to the GDP estimates based on market exchange rates, India was ranked the fifth largest economy from 2021 (Table 1 and Figure 1). Taken forward, the IMF projects that India will be the fourth largest economy in 2025 and the third largest economy in 2028. The U.S. is ranked first, and China is ranked second. But is this the only method to compare GDP sizes? It is globally accepted that conversions based on market exchange rates are robust only when the outcomes are closely linked to the prevailing exchange rates. Transactions in the “current account” of an economy are a case in point, which involves the flow of financial resources across countries. For example, how much did each country export in value terms? How much remittances did international migrants from each country send back home? When we try to compare GDP sizes across countries and time, market exchange rates deliver poorly. This is primarily because first, market exchange rates are highly volatile, which creates problems for stable temporal comparisons (see the fluctuations in Figure 1). Secondly, market exchange rates do not work well when “purchasing powers” of people are different between countries. For example, the price of a beer in New York may be $5 but only about ₹150 in Mumbai (or $1.80). The price of a Big Mac meal in McDonald’s may be $12 in New York but only about ₹385 (or $4.50) in Mumbai. Thirdly, the prices of non-traded goods tend to be far cheaper than traded goods in developing countries than in developed countries. For example, the monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment may be about $4,000 in New York but only about ₹70,000 (or $824) in Mumbai. The price of a haircut in New York may be $30, but only about ₹200 (or $2.40) in Mumbai. These differences across countries arise primarily because wages (and hence prices) are lower, and many non-traded sectors are labour-intensive, in developing countries than in the developed countries. If analysts ignore these differences, they will be underestimating", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/is-india-the-worlds-fourth-largest-economy/article69645115.ece", "domain": "thehindu.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 3, "title": "The Indian Express Explain Speaking: Why India is the third-largest economy, not fourth or fifth | Economy of India Explained", "snippet": "June 1, 2025 - Indian Economy: Recently, Niti Aayog CEO declared that India had overtaken Japan to become the fourth-largest economy in the world . We look at the data to check this claim", "full_content": "Over the weekend Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam declared that India had overtaken Japan to become the fourth-largest economy in the world. He based this claim on data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This claim reportedly led to two fairly divergent reactions. First, a wave of self-congratulation among Indians who take this particular detail as a clinching argument that the government of the day has brought about a fundamental improvement in India’s economy. Second, an examination of the claim and a counter-assertion, again based on IMF data, that India is still the fifth-largest economy, not the fourth. As it often happens in these days of deeply polarised opinions, the discussion has fast reduced to a dialogue of the deaf. Before answering, let’s broaden the scope of this explainer by making another claim (also based on IMF data): India is the third largest economy in the world, and, the fact is, it has been that way since Prime MinisterManmohan Singh-led UPA days. Here’s the proof: Look atCHART 1.It shows India’s GDP (dark green line) breaking away from the rest of the bunch. India became the third largest economy in 2009, when it, curiously enough, overtook Japan. An aside: There is one more pertinent break in this chart: It comes in 2016 when China overtakes the US as the largest economy in the world. The year 2016 is crucial as it was the year when the US first electedDonald Trumpand what has followed since is a dedicated US policy to contain China’s growing economic might not just under Trump but also under President Biden. Anyway, coming back to the status of India’s economy. Chart 1should raise at least one of the following two questions. Those who have been celebrating India’s rise as the fourth-largest economy might wonder how this particular calculation — that shows India becoming the third largest economy as early as 2009 — is done. And those who have been quibbling over when exactly will India overtake Japan are more likely to wonder why this fact — one that pegs India even higher in terms of GDP — has been ignored by the current government for the past 11 years. To understand all these issues one has to understand both the economics and the politics of such economic rankings. Suppose you and your classmate both get a similar kind of job, and both get roughly the same salary. You get Rs 50,000 per month and he gets Rs 45,000 per month. Your job is inMumbaiorBangalorewhile your friend’s job is in say Patna orLucknow. If your answer is that your friend is better off then you intuitively grasp the concept of “cost of living”. It is different from “inflation”. The cost of living captures the purchasing power of your salary: What can you buy in the same amount of money? For instance, the rent of a similar-sized apartment is likely to make a much bigger dent in your Mumbai salary than in your friend’s lower salary in Patna. Of course, prices may not vary for everything — a motorcycle is likely to be similarly priced in both cities but it is quite possible that a motorcycle will not help your commute in Mumbai while it is likely to be enough for your friend in Patna. Purchasing power changes both over time — recall how your parents or grandparents often reminisce about how much they could buy for say Rs 100 or even Rs 10 in “their time” — and over space — as exhibited from example above. The point is: How do we know that France or Japan is a bigger and better economy than India? One approach is to look at the nominal GDP: That is to add up the current market value of all final goods and services produced within the geographical boundaries of an economy in a year. Alternatively, you could add up the current incomes accruing to everyone in the economy. This variable — nominal GDP — is the one over which the current controversy is based. It shows how India overtook the UK in nominal GDP terms soon after the Covid pandemic. It is noteworthy that at that time Germany was the fourth-largest economy and Japan was the third-largest one. CHART 2further shows that as of the 2024 end, India was still behind both Japan and Germany but equally importantly, IMF’s projections (dotted line) show that India overtaking Japan and Germany is just a matter of time. A crucial thing to remember here is that nominal GDP that is plotted here in CHART 2 is in US dollar terms. As anearlier edition of ExplainSpeakingexplained, India’s GDP, even when it is counted in Indian rupees undergoes several revisions. Two, converting the Indian GDP from rupees to US dollars requires the exchange rate. This exchange rate has gone up and down over the time. In other words, if the Indian rupee weakens against the US dollar while the Japanese yen strengthens against the dollar, the relative positions can change even though the underlying GDP of India and Japan may not have changed even by one unit. But the bigger problem with nominal GDP comparisons is that they are not as meaningful because they miss out on the purchasing power ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-third-largest-economy-10033187/", "domain": "indianexpress.com", "trusted": true, "credibility_score": 1.0, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 4, "title": "Wikipedia Economy of India - Wikipedia", "snippet": "15 hours ago - It is the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income basis, India ranked 136th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP).", "full_content": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Economy of India Mumbai , the financial capital of India [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Currency Indian rupee (INR, ₹) Fiscal year 1 April – 31 March Trade organisations WTO , WCO , SAFTA , BIMSTEC , WFTU , BRICS , G-20 , BIS , AIIB , ADB and others Country group Developing [ 3 ] Lower-middle income economy [ 4 ] Newly industrialized country Statistics Population 1,428,627,663 ( 1st; 2024 est .)

Based on the latest World Economic Outlook report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the ten largest economies in 2025 have shown evolution and growth. These large economies boast their GDPs in the trillions and account for the majority of global economic output.The United States remains firmly in the lead, followed by China, though the gap is gradually closing. Meanwhile, India has made headlines by surpassing Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy, showing exponential growth and expanding influence. These rankings are based on GDP measured in US Dollars using market exchange rates and provide a realistic comparison of economic strength in global terms.Here are the top 10 economies of 2025 according to the IMF With a GDP of $30.507 trillion, the United States remains the world’s largest economy. Its economic dominance is backed by strong consumer spending, innovation, and a diverse industrial base. The country’s GDP per capita stands at $89,105, showing a high standard of living. The US economy has held the top position since the 20th century, and although China is closing in, the US leads in technology, finance, and global trade influence. China is the second-largest economy in 2025, with a GDP of $19.231 trillion. While still trailing behind the US, the country is consistently growing due to industrial strength and a vast consumer base. Its GDP per capita is $13,657. China's continued investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and technology make it a formidable global economic force that may overtake the US in the future. Germany stands as the third-largest economy in the world with a GDP of $4.744 trillion. The country is dependent on engineering and export-driven economy, and also plays a central role in the European Union. The country has a GDP per capita of $55,911, showing its strong productivity and high quality of life. Germany’s focus on innovation and sustainability regularly fuels its economic stability and global position. India made headlines in 2025 by overtaking Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. With a GDP of $4.187 trillion and a per capita GDP of $2,934, India combines rapid economic growth with a massive population. Its expanding service sector, tech industry, and domestic demand are major drivers of the economy. Though it has a lower GDP per capita, India’s long-term economic potential remains strong and globally significant. Japan now holds the fifth position, just behind India, with a GDP of $4.186 trillion. Its per capita GDP is $33,955, which represents a developed and affluent society. Despite slower growth in recent years, Japan remains a major player in technology, manufacturing, and finance. Challenges like an aging population persist, but Japan’s innovation and global business footprint keep it in the world’s top economic tier. The UK is the sixth-largest economy globally, with a GDP of $3.839 trillion and a per capita GDP of $54,949. Despite Brexit-related challenges, the UK has maintained a strong position through financial services, technology, and global trade. London continues to be a major global financial hub. France, the seventh-largest economy, has a GDP of $3.211 trillion and a GDP per capita of $46,792. As a founding member of the EU and home to a dynamic mix of agriculture, luxury goods, and aerospace industries, France plays a key role in shaping European economic policy. Its commitment to green energy and innovation supports its stable and competitive economic environment. Italy ranks eighth globally with a GDP of $2.422 trillion and a GDP per capita of $41,091. While known for its cultural heritage and tourism, Italy’s economy is also driven by manufacturing, fashion, and automotive exports. Despite economic challenges and political changes, Italy remains an important player within the EU and continues to contribute to global economic dialogue. Canada holds the ninth spot with a GDP of $2.225 trillion and a high per capita GDP of $53,558. Its economy benefits from natural resources, advanced technology, and a strong service sector. Though smaller in population compared to others in the top ten, Canada’s stable economic policies, rich resources, and trade partnerships keep it among the world’s economic leaders. Rounding out the top ten is Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, with a GDP of $2.125 trillion. Its per capita GDP is $10,234.

This is a significant milestone in India’s economic journey, positioning it behind only the United States, China, and Germany. Despite global uncertainties and internal economic challenges, India has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Historical Economic Trajectory 2004–2014 : Indian economy tripled in size during this decade, driven by liberalization, IT services boom, and strong investment flows. 2014–2024 : The economy only doubled in size during this period, largely due to disruptions such as: Demonetization (2016) Implementation of GST (2017) Covid-19 pandemic (2020–21) Global supply chain disruptions and inflation Inference : While growth was commendable, the pace was affected by both domestic policy shocks and global headwinds. Drivers of Recent Growth Strong services sector : India’s IT, fintech, telecom, and digital services have continued to attract investment and drive GDP. Domestic consumption : A growing middle class and urbanization trends have led to increased consumption levels. Digital economy expansion : Platforms like UPI, ONDC, and JAM trinity (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) have accelerated financial inclusion and formalization. Government schemes : PLI Scheme to boost manufacturing Gati Shakti Yojana for infrastructure push Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat for industrial resilience Key Structural Weaknesses Agricultural Distress Poor monsoons, low MSP hikes, and stagnant productivity have plagued the farm sector. Agriculture contributes around 18% to GDP but employs nearly 45% of the workforce—indicating hidden unemployment and underutilized labour . Manufacturing Underperformance Contribution to GDP remains around 16–17%, far from the target of 25%. Issues: High logistics cost, regulatory burdens, energy inefficiencies. Despite the PLI scheme, large-scale industrial transformation is yet to occur. Jobless Growth High GDP growth has not translated into adequate employment. Youth unemployment rate hovers around 15–18% , with graduates struggling to find skill-appropriate jobs. Informal sector still dominates employment, with low job security and wages. Rising Inequality and Low Per Capita Income India’s per capita GDP : ~$2,500 vs. Japan’s ~$34,000 — highlighting stark differences in average income levels. India ranks 141st globally in per capita GDP, behind Bangladesh (World Bank, 2024). Wealth inequality : Top 1% hold over 40% of the nation’s wealth . Bottom 50% own just 3% , as per Oxfam India’s report. Impact : Economic growth has not led to widespread economic empowerment . Access to education, healthcare, and social mobility remains limited for a large population. FDI Trends : A Mixed Picture Gross FDI inflows : Healthy and robust in sectors like electronics, fintech, and renewable energy. Net FDI : Fell by over 96% in 2024–25 , primarily due to increased repatriation, policy uncertainties, and global risk aversion. Need : More investor-friendly climate, dispute resolution, and stable regulatory frameworks. Research & Development Deficit India spends <0.7% of GDP on R&D , significantly lower than: China (2.4%) USA (3.5%) Israel (5%) Innovation and knowledge-driven sectors remain underdeveloped, limiting long-term productivity gains. Solution : Create stronger academia-industry linkages Incentivize private sector R&D Boost funding for institutions like CSIR, IITs, and DRDO Geopolitical and Global Economic Risks Tariff wars : US-China and now increasing US-EU trade frictions create uncertainty for export markets. Global slowdown : IMF predicts subdued global growth of around 3%, which could impact India’s exports and capital inflows. Oil price volatility : As a net importer, India remains vulnerable to spikes in crude prices. Way Forward Boost Inclusive Growth Strengthen rural development and agro-processing industries Improve social infrastructure: health, education, housing Implement a Universal Basic Income pilot in vulnerable districts Job Creation Strategy Promote MSMEs and startups through tax breaks and credit access Focus on labour-intensive sectors: textiles, tourism, food processing Expand skilling through revamped ITIs and Skill India 2.0 Reform Manufacturing Ease land acquisition laws and reduce compliance burden Push industrial clusters and export-oriented SEZs Improve logistics through Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and rail freight corridors Sustain Fiscal Discipline Rationalize subsidies and enhance public investment efficiency Expand tax base through GST compliance and direct tax reforms Conclusion India’s rise to the 4th largest economy is a remarkable feat, especially in light of recent global disruptions. However, the true strength of a nation lies not just in aggregate GDP, but in how that growth transforms lives across regions, classes, and communities .

U.S.:Sunday-Thursday,23:00-0000 ETAsia:Monday-Friday, 11:00-12:00 SIN/HK, 08:30-09:30 IndiaEurope:Monday-Friday, 0500-06:00 CET A top Indian official's recent claim that the South Asian powerhouse has become the world's fourth-largest economy has created a lot of buzz in the country's social media, with an outpouring of self-congratulatory messages. While India has takengiant strides in boosting its GDP— it was ranked No. 10 in 2014 — and continues to be the fastest-growing major economy, it's best to take the latest claims with a fistful of salt. Briefing the media on Sunday, B.V.R. Subrahmanyam, CEO of India's state-run think tank Niti Aayog said, \"we are the fourth-largest economy as I speak ... and this is not my data. This is IMF [international monetary fund] data.\" \"India today is larger than Japan,\" Subrahmanyam said, adding that the nation will go on to displace Germany as the third-largest economy, just behind the U.S. and China in around three years. IMF data, however, projectsIndia's economy to reach $4.187 trillion in 2025, marginally surpassing Japan's $4.186 trillion. So while not already there, the country is very much on the path to becoming the fourth-largest economic powerhouse, preceded by Germany, China and the U.S. Keeping the trajectory in focus, and putting aside the merits of the claim, what is it that's working for the country — and what is holding it back? \"Long-term structural dynamic,\" driven by India's huge demographic and growing educated youth population, isenhancing India's capabilitiesin technology and services, while also paving itsambitions to become a manufacturing hub, said Malcolm Dorson, senior portfolio manager at Global X ETFs — one of the largest foreign asset owners in India. Dorson also sees \"tactical tailwinds\" from lower oil and higher gold prices, given India imports around 80% of its energy needs, while roughly 20% of the nation's household savings in physical gold. Collectively, these factors make India a \"fine-tuned compounding machine,\" he said, adding that the country gaining a spot in the top four by GDP ranking \"is a done deal.\" Dhiraj Nim, foreign exchange strategist and economist at ANZ Bank agrees:It should not be surprising if India becomes the world's fourth-largest economy around mid to end this year, aided byimproving domestic consumptionas demand in rural clusters improves. Consumption constitutesover 56% of India's economy— making it the top growth engine. Rural areas accounted for nearly 40% of overall consumer goods sales in the first quarter of 2025,data from market research firm NielsenIQ shows. A sizable number of India's rural population is farmers, so Nim expects a pickup in their spending in the upcoming quarters with better weather conditions facilitating higher crop yields and in turn stronger income and purchasing power, with falling inflation also supporting consumption. He also expects urban consumption to grow, albeit at a slower pace, following tax cuts and stimulus doled out in the budget earlier this year, with more rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India offering an added boost. The benefits of India's economic growth will translate into increased capital flows, as foreign investors would want to capitalize on it, Dorson said. \"This could lead to higher valuations, which inherently would translate into more supply, and deeper capital markets. We could also see Indian equities more prominently included in global exchanges, which would lead to more flows,\" he said. India has strong tailwinds supporting its economy, but it needs to undertake several reforms to ensure sustained growth. While India is set to be the world's fourth-largest economy,there is a \"huge disconnect in the standard of living and the social, economic and physical infrastructural between India and Japan,\" Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard said. India'scurrent per capita GDPis $2,880, a fraction of Japan's $33,960, IMF data shows. \"There's so much work that really needs to be done in India to bridge this gap and it starts from increasing capital expenditure on infrastructure such as transportation networks, to improving access to education, workforce skills upgrading and jobs in general,\" Deveshwar noted. ANZ's Nim calls India becoming the world's fourth-largest economy merely a \"natural course of events.\" \"It really means not much to me. India is now the fifth-largest economy, but is not very prosperous, so more work needs to be done to increase the prosperity of citizens,", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/29/cnbc-inside-india-newsletter-india-set-to-be-the-worlds-fourth-largest-economy.html", "domain": "cnbc.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 11, "title": "Press Information Bureau India Becoming An Economic Powerhouse", "snippet": "India, the world’s fourth-largest economy, has emerged as the fastest-growing major economy and is on track to become the world’s third-largest economy with a projected GDP of $7.3 trillion by 2030.", "full_content": "JavaScript must be enabled in order for you to use the Site in standard view.

This transformation is the result of a decade ofdecisive governance,visionary reforms, andglobal engagementunderPrime Minister Narendra Modi. Driven by robust domestic demand, a dynamic demographic profile, and sustained economic reforms, India is asserting its rising influencein global trade, investment, and innovation. At theKautilya Economic Conclave,renowned economist Jagdish Bhagwatiremarked:“In the old days, the World Bank used to tell India what to do, but now, India tells the World Bank what to do.”This statement powerfully reflects India’s shift inlast Eleven years, from a dependent economy to aself-reliant,globally competitive powerhouse. At the core of this transformation is the vision ofAatmanirbhar Bharat, a movement that promotesinnovation,entrepreneurship, andtechnological sovereignty.

Atcurrent prices,GDPhas increased from₹106.57 lakh crorein2014–15to an estimated₹331.03 lakh crorein2024–25, an approximatethreefold risein just ten years. In2024–25alone,nominal GDPgrew by9.9%over the previous year, whilereal GDP (at constant prices)increased by6.5%, reflecting sustained economic momentum. This steep growth reflects the country’s expanding economic base and rising income levels. Gross domestic product(GDP) measures the value of all the goods and services produced in a country, whileGross value added(GVA) is the value added to other (purchased) goods and services, which are used to produce within an economy. During the same periodReal GVArose by6.4%, andnominal GVAby9.5%.Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE)grew by7.3%, driven by a recovery inrural demand, reaching itshighest share of GDP (61.8%) since 2002–03. Theservices sectorhas remained thesteadiest contributor to GVA, with its share rising from50.6% in FY14to around55% in FY25. It also provides employment to approximately30% of the workforce. In addition to its direct contribution, services play an increasingly vital role in“servicification” of manufacturing, enhancing value through services used in bothproductionandpost-productionstages. Fast Fact:Tax revenues hit record highs withGSTcollections peaking inApril 2025andtax-to-GDP ratioestimated at12%forFY26. This sustained momentum is the result of astructural transformationled by theGovernment, prioritisingtransparency,ease of doing business, andlong-term investmentsacrossmanufacturing,MSMEs,digital services, andinfrastructure. India’s total exports have shown remarkable growth over the past decade, rising fromUS$ 468 billionin 2013–14 toUS$ 825 billionin 2024–25, marking a substantial increase of approximately76%. This growth was supported by a marginal increase inmerchandise exports, which stood atUS$ 437.42 billionin FY 2024–25 compared toUS$ 437.07 billionin the previous year, reflecting stability in goods-based trade. Over the decade, merchandise exports rose fromUS$ 310 billionin 2013–14 toUS$ 437.42 billionin 2024–25, marking a39% increase, driven by sectors such as engineering goods, petroleum products, and electronics. Services exports more than doubled, expanding fromUS$ 158 billionin 2013–14 toUS$ 387 billionin 2024–25, registering a remarkablegrowth.

Kohli plays for (and previous", "full_content": "Alphabetically sorted top ten of players who have played the most matches across formats in the last 12 months India has given to the world many a great cricketer but none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them. This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever before of his bowlers, especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batter for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in the Test rankings and a first-ever Test series win in Australia. India won 40 out of the 68 Tests in which Kohli led, making him the fourth-most successful captain in the world, behind Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh. Kohli scored Test hundreds in and against every country he played, other than in Bangladesh. He smashed records for number of matches taken to reach eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs, and became the first batter to score 50 hundreds in ODIs - getting to the milestone in the 2023 World Cup semi-final, in the presence of Tendulkar, the man whose record he broke. Between 2016 and 2018, Kohli scored 3596 runs in 35 Tests at an average of 66.59, with 14 hundreds and eight fifties in 58 innings, with the 2018 tour of England being a high point. There was a dip thereafter - his average, over 55 at its peak after he scored his career-best of 254 against South Africa in Pune in 2019, slipped to around 46 by the end. He retired from Test cricket midway through IPL 2025. Fans turned up in whites at the Chinnaswamy for his next match to pay tribute to his red-ball career. The encounter was rained off but the sentiment remained: an appropriate display of affection for a player who had revitalised the home crowd's love for five-day cricket, yet ended his career with an average of 30.72 in his final 39 Tests. If a hint of what could have been remained about his Test career - ending with 9230 runs, the least prolific among the Fab Four - he seemed to be at peace with what was. He would soon go on to win the IPL trophy for the first time, on his 18th attempt, and declare the victory to still be \"five levels under Test cricket\". Kohli is a world champion multiple times over, having captained India to the 2008 Under-19 World Cup title and winning four more ICC trophies with the senior side: the 50-over World Cup in 2011, Champions Trophies in 2013 and 2025, and the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he scored 76 in the final. When he burst onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big batter as the batting greats of the previous era began to retire, but Kohli wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to do so. He was widely credited for changing attitudes towards fitness in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a criterion for selection. He was quite simply India's most powerful captain. At the centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was run by interim administrators who knew better than to draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was never any cause to doubt his intent: to do things that will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him. - Virat Kohli is the only player in the Indian Premier League (IPL) to have played all seasons for one team: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) - He was picked by RCB soon after he captained India to victory in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup and has been retained by them ever since - Kohli is the IPL's highest run-scorer and the only one with more than 8000 runs - He holds the record for most IPL centuries (eight) as well as most runs in a season (973 in 2016).

In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast. Grind through the ranks He soon joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka, come August 2008. In the absence of the regular openers, Virat Kohli was given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series. He played some commendable knocks in his extended run as an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series. However, the established and formidable pair of Tendulkar and Sehwag kept Kohli out of the team The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level; that junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over the bowling attacks. He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too, lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory. The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh in the selectors' minds. Cementing a national spot The selectors had no choice but to give Kohli another go in the Indian side, and this time he strung together a number of impressive scores. After being given an extended run, he repaid their faith by notching up his maiden ODI hundred in an impressive run-chase against Sri Lanka in December 2009 - his first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases. In the World Cup final of 2011, the biggest stage of them all, Kohli, along with his Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated rescue effort with an 83-run stand after losing the openers early. This knock played a crucial role in setting the platform for MS Dhoni's fabled knock of 91*, which eventually won India the World Cup on that enchanting evening in Mumbai. In the hangover of the World Cup euphoria, Kohli continued to take giant strides in the limited-overs format. Three years after his ODI debut, he was finally handed the coveted Test cap in the Caribbean islands in July 2011, owing to the need to rest the senior players. After a series each against the Dukes ball and the SG ball, it was now time for his trial against the Kookaburra Down Under. In the first two Tests, he seemed to lack the technique to play in Australia, maintaining his low stance on the bouncy tracks. He also had a rather restricting trigger movement with his front-foot routinely coming across towards off-stump, thereby hindering the necessary movement to play back-foot shots such as the pull and the cut. A baptism by fire Down Under The selectors and the captain persisted with him going into the 3rd Test, and he delivered a break-through performance on a bouncy Perth wicket - an impressive 75 - where a visible change in technique was visible. He managed to stand tall, with a more open stance, and exhibited the back-foot shots in his repertoire during the course of the innings. The volatile Kohli managed to overshadow his impropriety in conduct with his performance in the final Test of the series. Notching up India's only century of a disastrous tour, Kohli was the shining light in amidst the chaos, as he stroked his way to a hundred in Adelaide exhibiting the will to improve and extraordinary focus under pressure in the searing heat and pressure of Australia. While he grappled and clawed his way into the Test side, he went on a record-breaking spree in ODIs: the Indian record for the fastest to multiples-of-thousand runs in ODIs, culminating in the world record for the fastest to 9000 runs in ODIs. He was also the highest run-scorer for India in ODIs for three consecutive calendar years - 2010, 2011 and 2012 and won the ICC ODI cric", "url": "https://www.cricbuzz.com/profiles/1413/virat-kohli", "domain": "cricbuzz.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 8000}, {"source_number": 13, "title": "Virat Kohli Biography - Cricket For India", "snippet": "In 2008, he captained the under-19 Indian Cricket team in the World Cup, leading India to victory.

He was born into a Punjabi Hindu family – his mother Saroj was a housewife and father Prem Nath worked as a criminal lawyer. His love for cricket started early. At just three years old, he would grab a bat and ask his father to bowl to him. This early passion became the foundation of one of cricket’s most brilliant careers. Family backing : A turning point came in 1998 when neighbors suggested that professional training would serve his natural talent better than street cricket. His father received offers to move his son to powerful clubs that guaranteed selection. Yet Prem Nath turned these down, choosing the right path over easy shortcuts. This decision helped shape Kohli’s character and his approach to cricket. Educational journey : He first studied at Vishal Bharti Public School before moving to Savior Convent in ninth grade to focus on cricket. His family’s choice showed their dedication to nurturing his talent while balancing it with education. Training under Rajkumar Sharma The crucial meeting : Nine-year-old Virat and his father walked into the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) on May 30, 1998. They met coach Rajkumar Sharma – a moment that changed cricket history. Sharma saw something unique in the young boy, noting how his throws “thudded into the gloves of the wicketkeeper”. Disciplined development : Sharma’s guidance brought out Kohli’s dedication. “Virat never came late for the nets. He took great care of his gear. He wanted his pads and bats spotless. He always wanted to dominate,” his coach remembers. Sharma started the West Delhi Cricket Academy on May 30, 1998, which became famous for training talented batsmen like Kohli. Personal tragedy : Life changed on December 18, 2006, during a Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka when Kohli’s father died from a cerebral attack. The next day, Kohli returned to bat and scored 90 runs, helping Delhi avoid the follow-on. His mental strength amazed his coaches and teammates. Chetan Chauhan noted his determination and steadfast attitude during this tough time. U-19 World Cup triumph as captain Rising through ranks : Kohli’s path to international cricket started in youth games. He played his first junior cricket match in October 2002 at Luhnu Cricket Ground against Himachal Pradesh, scoring his first domestic half-century at Feroze Shah Kotla. The 2003-04 season saw him lead the U-15 team and score his first century (119) against Jammu and Kashmir. World Cup glory : Kohli’s youth career peaked when he led India to victory in the 2008 U-19 World Cup. The final happened on March 2, 2008, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. India beat South Africa by 12 runs (Duckworth-Lewis method). Kohli scored 20 runs while Tanmay Srivastava made 46 as India set 159 as the target. This victory gave India its second Under-19 World Cup title after Mohammad Kaif’s team won in 2000. Domestic cricket breakthrough with Delhi Ranji debut : His first-class career started on November 23, 2006, in the Ranji Trophy opener against Tamil Nadu. He scored just 10 runs. Starting at 18, he went on to score five centuries and five fifties for Delhi over six years. Statistical excellence : The numbers tell his story. He made 257 runs in six matches at 36.71 average during the 2006/07 Ranji season. His game improved the next year with 373 runs in five matches at 53.28, including two centuries and a top score of 169. His best form came in 2009/10 and 2010/11 when he averaged 93.50 and 56.50. His final Ranji stats show 1,573 runs at 50.77, with five centuries and six fifties in 23 matches.

A dream like every other young kid in India to represent the country in the gentleman’s game. It is this vigor and fervor for the game of cricket that has helped this extremely talented young boy from Delhi to scale great heights at a very young age. He was barely in his teens when he led the India Under-19 team to a World Cup victory in Kuala Lumpur in 2008 which was a pointer of bigger and better things to come in the future. After that famous victory, it was not long before he made his entry into the senior team and Kohli was soon brushing shoulders with the best in the business and his cricketing idol Sachin Tendulkar. The stylish right-handed batsman banked on the opportunities at disposal and displayed a tremendous sense of maturity as if to show he belonged. He was termed brash and aggressive for being expressive on and off the field, but Kohli imbibed all of those qualities in his gameplay only to become better with each passing game. He began chasing totals for India with ridiculous ease and India had found a stable batsman in the middle order for the long run. Such is his batting prowess and cricketing mind that Ray Jennings(his coach with Royal Challengers Bangalore) touted him to be the leader of future India. Kohli made his mark in the shorter formats of the game but got a chance to don the whites in 2011. He registered his maiden Test century against Australia in Adelaide in January 2012 and followed it up with impressive centuries in India and abroad - namely South Africa and New Zealand.

The approach paper said a Viksit Bharat @ 2047 will be a USD 30 trillion economy. \"It will have all the attributes of a developed country with a per capita income that is comparable to the high-income countries of the world today,; the paper said. According to the paper, in order to achieve the goal of a Viksit Bharat by 2047, an overall framework for strategic interventions and reforms based on six key building blocks, with a total of 26 themes covered across all the building blocks have been identified. The six key building blocks are: Macro-Economic Goals and Strategy; Empowered Citizens; A Thriving and Sustainable Economy; Technology and Innovation Leadership; A Global Leader, Vishwa Bandhu; Enabling factors -- Governance, Security and Justice delivery.

With a GDP of $4 trillion, the country has overtaken Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data cited by NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam. The announcement marks a pivotal moment in India’s growth story one driven by structural reforms, demographic strength, and resilient consumption. According to a report by ANI, NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam confirmed that India has now overtaken Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. “We are a $4 trillion economy as I speak… and this is not my data. This is IMF data. India today is larger than Japan,” Subrahmanyam told ANI. The IMF’s April World Economic Outlook estimates India’s nominal GDP will reach $4.187 trillion in FY2026, narrowly surpassing Japan’s projection of $4.186 trillion. India held the fifth position globally until 2024. Looking ahead, Subrahmanyam told ANI that India is well-positioned to overtake Germany, “It’s only the United States, China, and Germany which are larger… If we stick to what is being planned, it’s a matter of another two, two and a half to three years, we would become the third-largest economy.” He added that India’s economic trajectory is backed by its young and expanding population. “India is at a takeoff stage… and we are blessed with this demographic window for the next 20 to 25 years. The Prime Minister has already asked states to draft vision documents and this planning is showing visible results,” Subrahmanyam said, as quoted by ANI. India’s economic leap comes at a time when global trade tensions are high, and the country is actively negotiating across multiple trade corridors. Post Donald Trump’s returned to Oval office, the US imposed up to 26 per cent tariffs on specific Indian goods. These remain in effect, with India now seeking a full exemption as part of bilateral negotiations. The first phase of a restructured trade agreement is anticipated by July 2025, according to recent reports. Dialogue between New Delhi and Washington has intensified. India is pushing for tariff relaxations in sectors like agriculture and textiles, while the US is keen on securing digital trade guarantees and enhanced data access. India has also finalised a landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United Kingdom. Under the pact, tariffs on 90 per cent of British exports to India will be reduced, with 85 per cent of goods becoming fully duty-free over the next 10 years, an ambitious effort to expand India’s trade network beyond traditional partners. Despite geopolitical uncertainties and tightening global credit conditions, the IMF projects India’s economy to grow by 6.2 per cent in 2025 and 6.3 per cent in 2026. These figures remain well above the projected global growth of 2.8 per cent and 3.0 per cent, reinforcing India’s position as the fastest-growing major economy. India’s journey from the fifth largest to the fourth-largest economy reflects both economic resilience and strategic execution. As trade dynamics shift and global economies grapple with uncertainty, India’s sustained growth, favourable demographics, and policy clarity position it to potentially overtake Germany and enter the top three global economies soon.", "url": "https://www.wionews.com/business-economy/india-surpasses-japan-to-become-4th-largest-economy-at-4-trillion-niti-aayog-ceo-1748158896219", "domain": "wionews.com", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.6200000000000001, "content_length": 3420}, {"source_number": 5, "title": "India becomes 4 th largest economy , but challenges remain | LinkedIn", "snippet": "India is the 4 th largest economy in the world !!!

In a milestone moment for the #IndianEconomy , India has officially overtaken Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy by GDP. Once considered an ambitious target, this achievement reflects the country’s rapid economic strides and resilience over the past two decades. Reflecting on this transformation, Anand Mahindra stated, “When I was in business school, the idea of India overtaking Japan in GDP felt like a distant, almost audacious dream. Today, that milestone is no longer theoretical — it’s a reality.” Japan, long regarded as a global economic titan, has historically symbolized industrial strength and efficiency. India's rise beyond it in terms of overall GDP underscores the growing ambition, ingenuity, and enterprise of millions of Indians across sectors and regions. However, experts caution that the real work begins now. While overtaking Japan in terms of aggregate GDP is a significant symbolic and economic milestone, the focus must now shift to per capita GDP — a measure of the average income and living standards of Indian citizens. \"As we celebrate, we must stay dissatisfied,\" the statement continued. \"India’s next leap must be in per capita income, not just surpassing Germany or other economies in nominal terms.\" To maintain momentum and ensure that growth is inclusive and sustainable, India must accelerate structural reforms in key areas: Governance and policy efficiency Manufacturing and job creation. Infrastructure development. Education and skill-building. Access to capital for startups and MSMEs. The sentiment is clear: India’s economic size is growing — but to truly empower every citizen, the country must now focus on quality, depth, and distribution of wealth. #indiaGDP #japanGDP #indiaVSjapan #IndianEconomy #perCapitaGDP #anandMahindra #businessLeaders #startupInsights #startupro 1,423 73 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook X Sanatan Rising 6mo Report this comment India should 1) Fix Pakistan for once. 2) Send back infiltrators by implementing NRC 3) Implement UCC and ONOC 4) Build walled business cities with intra visa system and Union territory status. 5) Introduce fair competition policy and save traditional business from online onslaught and accumulation of wealth in the hands of few.

However, the reality on the ground, with infrastructure challenges and disparities in wealth distribution, doesn't reflect this economic status. Despite the official recognition, the benefits of this growth are not visibly trickling down to improve everyday life for many citizens. Just in Jest We just got the memo: India has become the 4th-largest economy in the world, with a projected GDP of $4.187 bn for FY26. We've also been told that India has surpassed Japan in the GDP stakes. But the way the thermometer says 30° C and yet it 'feels like' 48° C, why does it not feel like we're the 4th-biggest economy in the world? Look out of the window, and it doesn't seem viksit-y just yet. India could be the opposite of a 'Potemkin Village' - you know, a false facade named after the Russian military leader Grigory Potemkin, who allegedly erected fake villages during Empress Catherine the Great's visit to Crimea to make the region look more prosperous than it really was. In India's case, things look worse than they really may be. Potholes still resemble gurgly swirlpools after a good rain. Public hygiene and civic sense are still Fourth World-ish in certain places. Government offices still greet you with the timeless charm of a printer that hasn't worked since 1991. There's wealth, no doubt - just not the kind that trickles down but rather evaporates into gated communities. In real rich countries, even the wealthy step outdoors for a view or to mingle. Here, bubbles help. But let's make the best of what we have: the official stamp that after the US, China and Germany, India is in the posh line. So what if it doesn't feel like it?

City Air News Oct 12, 2025 05:52 0 Facebook Twitter Panchkula/Chandigarh, October 12, 2025: BJP National General Secretary Tarun Chugh today hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, saying that the dream of Atmanirbhar Bharat has now become a living reality. He said that in just five years since Modi ji gave the clarion call for self-reliance in May 2020, India has risen to become the fourth largest economy in the world — a remarkable achievement born out of the collective strength and resolve of 140 crore Indians. Speaking as the Chief Guest at the GST Bachat Mahotsav and Atmanirbhar Bharat Sammelan held at the PWD Rest House auditorium in Panchkula, Chugh said that Atmanirbhar Bharat was never a mere scheme, but a grand mission to secure India’s economic, cultural, and strategic independence. He recalled how, during the pandemic, India turned adversity into strength: “When we depended on foreign countries even for masks and PPE kits, within months India emerged as a leading global producer. This is the identity of self-reliance, the true strength of New India,” he said. Chugh underlined that under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, every sector has registered historic achievements. Electronics production has grown six times, mobile manufacturing has surged 28 times, defence exports have crossed Rs. 23,000 crore to more than 100 countries, and India has established itself as the pharmacy hub of the world. Renewable energy capacity has reached 234 GW, the semiconductor sector has attracted investments of Rs. 1.60 lakh crore, and Digital India has generated production worth Rs. 8.56 lakh crore with 1.35 lakh new jobs. “From Chandrayaan-3 to Operation Sindoor, from AI to green hydrogen, every milestone stands as proof of Modi ji’s vision,” Chugh said. He stressed that the double-engine government has ensured that Haryana too has become a strong pillar in this national journey. Farmers are being empowered with irrigation and crop insurance, MSMEs in auto, textiles, and agri-business are gaining new strength, and women and youth are being encouraged through self-help groups and startups. Chugh concluded by saying that the roadmap is clear: by 2030 India will be the third largest economy, by 2040 the second, and by 2047 a developed nation. “Atmanirbhar Bharat is not just a slogan, it is the truth of New India — a truth shaped by the labour and determination of 140 crore Indians,” he said. The event, presided over by Panchkula District President Ajay Mittal, saw the participation of State Vice President Banto Kataria, Kalka MLA Shakti Rani Sharma, Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal, former Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, campaign state co-convenor Preeti Johar, senior leader Shyamlal Bansal, Shivalik Board Vice Chairman Om Prakash Devnagar, District General Secretary Jai Kaushik, and constituency convenor K. Chandan, along with a large gathering of prominent traders, doctors, lawyers, educationists, and social workers. In his presidential address, Ajay Mittal welcomed all the dignitaries and announced that numerous awareness programs would be organized across Panchkula district under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Sankalp Abhiyan. He said BJP workers would personally meet traders to encourage the promotion of indigenous products. He further informed that a major convention of local workers, artisans, sculptors, handicraft industries, street vendors, and small shopkeepers will soon be held in Panchkula. It may be noted that BJP is organizing GST Bachat Mahotsav and Atmanirbhar Bharat Sammelans across the country at the assembly level, under which the Panchkula district organization has successfully conducted the program in both its constituencies.

The country’s GDP has touched the $4 trillion mark, placing it behind only the United States, China and Germany in size. Speaking after the 10th Governing Council meeting of the policy think tank, Subrahmanyam attributed the rise to a combination of domestic reforms and a global environment that is increasingly leaning in India’s favour. advertisement “As I speak, we are now the fourth-largest economy. We’ve reached a $4 trillion economy,” he told reporters, citing the latest IMF estimates to underscore India’s economic ascent. “Only the US, China and Germany are ahead of us. If we stick to our path, we could become the third-largest in just 2.5 to 3 years.” The milestone comes amid an evolving global economic landscape where India is positioning itself as a key alternative manufacturing hub. Subrahmanyam responded to recent remarks by former US President Donald Trump, who said iPhones sold in the US should be made domestically rather than in countries like India. “The specifics of future US tariffs remain unclear,” he said, “but India will continue to offer a cost-competitive manufacturing base regardless of those dynamics.” He also revealed that a fresh wave of asset monetisation initiatives is in the pipeline. The government is preparing a second round of its asset monetisation programme, expected to be rolled out in August. The economic milestone comes at a politically significant time, just as India looks to deepen its role in global supply chains and attract fresh investments under its ‘Make in India’ push. - Ends Published By: Atul Mishra Published On: May 25, 2025 Trending Reel Watch Live TV", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/india-becomes-fourth-largest-economy-ahead-of-japan-niti-aayog-ceo-2730153-2025-05-25", "domain": "indiatoday.in", "trusted": false, "credibility_score": 0.5700000000000001, "content_length": 2252}, {"source_number": 10, "title": "India overtakes Japan to become 4 th largest economy at $ 4 trillion...", "snippet": "India is projected to remain the fastest-growing large economy for 2025 and 2026, reaffirming its dominance in the global economic landscape.

Asked to comment on NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam's remark that India has become the fourth largest economy in the world, the eminent economist said: \"So this is a complicated question, and I really do not know what the words anybody has used. \"Perhaps there was some word which was missed or something.\" Citing IMF data, Subrahmanyam, last week, said that the size of the Indian economy today is larger than Japan's. \"We are a $4 trillion economy as I speak,\" the NITI Aayog CEO had said. \"It is only the US, China and Germany which are larger than India, and if we stick to what is being planned and what is being thought through, in 2.5-3 years, we will be the third largest economy,\" Subrahmanyam had said. Explaining further, Virmani said, \"When we discuss the size of economies publicly, we generally use US dollar current prices.\" Virmani further pointed out that 'when we compare economy, we generally do it in terms of annual GDP'. Virmani said IMF in its WEO report released in April gave a precise number, which showed that India's GDP for the full year 2025, would become higher than that of Japan. \"I would say that I am pretty confident that that will happen, but the exact data will probably not be available till January or February, because we are talking about the whole year,\" he observed. India's nominal GDP for 2025 (FY26) is expected to be $4.187 trillion marginally more than the likely GDP of Japan which is estimated at $4.186 trillion, the IMF had said. According to IMF data, India's per capita income has doubled from $1,438 in 2013-14 to $2,880 in 2025. The IMF in its WEO report also said the Indian economy is projected to grow at 6.2 per cent in 2025-26, slower than earlier estimated rate of 6.5 per cent, due to escalated trade tensions and global uncertainty. \"For India, the growth outlook is relatively more stable at 6.2 per cent in 2025, supported by private consumption, particularly in rural areas,\" the IMF had said. According to the report, the global growth is projected at 2.8 per cent in 2025, lower by 0.5 percentage points estimated earlier. In 2026, the global economy is estimated to grow at 3 per cent.
