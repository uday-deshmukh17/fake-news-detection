Briefing reporters after the 10th Governing Council meeting of Niti Aayog, Mr Subrahmanyam said the overall geopolitical and economic environment is favourable to India. \"We are the fourth largest economy as I speak. We are a USD 4 trillion economy as I speak,\" he said. Citing IMF data, mR Subrahmanyam said India today is larger than Japan. \"It is only the US, China and Germany which are larger than India, and if we stick to what is being planned and what is being thought through, in 2.5-3 years, we will be the third largest economy,\" Mr Subrahmanyam. Responding to a question on US President Donald Trump's recent statement that he expects Apple iPhones that will be sold in the US to be manufactured in America and not India, or anyplace else, Mr Subrahmanyam said, \"What the tariff will be, is uncertain.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) report released in April had said that India is expected to be the fourth largest economy in the world with a GDP of USD 4.19 trillion in 2025, ahead of Japan. India's nominal GDP for 2025 (FY26) is expected to be USD 4.187 billion marginally more than the likely GDP of Japan which is estimated at USD 4.187 billion, the IMF had said. Live Events According to IMF data, India's per capita income has doubled from USD 1,438 in 2013-14 to USD 2,880 in 2025. The IMF in its WEO report also said the Indian economy is projected to grow at 6.2 per cent in 2025-26, slower than earlier estimated rate of 6.5 per cent, due to escalated trade tensions and global uncertainty. \"For India, the growth outlook is relatively more stable at 6.2 per cent in 2025, supported by private consumption, particularly in rural areas,\" the IMF had said. According to the report, the global growth is projected at 2.8 per cent in 2025, lower by 0.5 percentage points estimated earlier. In 2026, the global economy is estimated to grow at 3 per cent. NITI Aayog approach paper titled \"Viksit Rajya For Viksit Bharat @ 2047' said from being considered a part of the 'fragile five' economies of the world, India rose to become the top five economies of the world in just a decade. The World Bank defines high-income countries as those whose annual per capita income is more than USD 14,005 (2024- 25). India has the potential and aims to be a high-income country by 2047. The approach paper said a Viksit Bharat @ 2047 will be a USD 30 trillion economy. \"It will have all the attributes of a developed country with a per capita income that is comparable to the high-income countries of the world today,; the paper said. According to the paper, in order to achieve the goal of a Viksit Bharat by 2047, an overall framework for strategic interventions and reforms based on six key building blocks, with a total of 26 themes covered across all the building blocks have been identified. The six key building blocks are: Macro-Economic Goals and Strategy; Empowered Citizens; A Thriving and Sustainable Economy; Technology and Innovation Leadership; A Global Leader, Vishwa Bandhu; Enabling factors -- Governance, Security and Justice delivery.

      "full_content": "Amid global trade tension, NITI Aayog CEO said that with a GDP of $4 trillion, India has overtaken Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy, India has rewritten the global economic leaderboard. With a GDP of $4 trillion, the country has overtaken Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data cited by NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam. The announcement marks a pivotal moment in India’s growth story one driven by structural reforms, demographic strength, and resilient consumption. According to a report by ANI, NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam confirmed that India has now overtaken Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. “We are a $4 trillion economy as I speak… and this is not my data. This is IMF data. India today is larger than Japan,” Subrahmanyam told ANI. The IMF’s April World Economic Outlook estimates India’s nominal GDP will reach $4.187 trillion in FY2026, narrowly surpassing Japan’s projection of $4.186 trillion. India held the fifth position globally until 2024. Looking ahead, Subrahmanyam told ANI that India is well-positioned to overtake Germany, “It’s only the United States, China, and Germany which are larger… If we stick to what is being planned, it’s a matter of another two, two and a half to three years, we would become the third-largest economy.” He added that India’s economic trajectory is backed by its young and expanding population. “India is at a takeoff stage… and we are blessed with this demographic window for the next 20 to 25 years. The Prime Minister has already asked states to draft vision documents and this planning is showing visible results,” Subrahmanyam said, as quoted by ANI. India’s economic leap comes at a time when global trade tensions are high, and the country is actively negotiating across multiple trade corridors. Post Donald Trump’s returned to Oval office, the US imposed up to 26 per cent tariffs on specific Indian goods. These remain in effect, with India now seeking a full exemption as part of bilateral negotiations. The first phase of a restructured trade agreement is anticipated by July 2025, according to recent reports. Dialogue between New Delhi and Washington has intensified. India is pushing for tariff relaxations in sectors like agriculture and textiles, while the US is keen on securing digital trade guarantees and enhanced data access. India has also finalised a landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United Kingdom. Under the pact, tariffs on 90 per cent of British exports to India will be reduced, with 85 per cent of goods becoming fully duty-free over the next 10 years, an ambitious effort to expand India’s trade network beyond traditional partners. Despite geopolitical uncertainties and tightening global credit conditions, the IMF projects India’s economy to grow by 6.2 per cent in 2025 and 6.3 per cent in 2026. These figures remain well above the projected global growth of 2.8 per cent and 3.0 per cent, reinforcing India’s position as the fastest-growing major economy. India’s journey from the fifth largest to the fourth-largest economy reflects both economic resilience and strategic execution. As trade dynamics shift and global economies grapple with uncertainty, India’s sustained growth, favourable demographics, and policy clarity position it to potentially overtake Germany and enter the top three global economies soon.",

      "full_content": "Startupro.in 154,028 followers 6mo Report this post India Becomes 4th Largest Economy — But the Real Climb Has Just Begun. In a milestone moment for the #IndianEconomy , India has officially overtaken Japan to become the world’s fourth-largest economy by GDP. Once considered an ambitious target, this achievement reflects the country’s rapid economic strides and resilience over the past two decades. Reflecting on this transformation, Anand Mahindra stated, “When I was in business school, the idea of India overtaking Japan in GDP felt like a distant, almost audacious dream. Today, that milestone is no longer theoretical — it’s a reality.” Japan, long regarded as a global economic titan, has historically symbolized industrial strength and efficiency. India's rise beyond it in terms of overall GDP underscores the growing ambition, ingenuity, and enterprise of millions of Indians across sectors and regions. However, experts caution that the real work begins now. While overtaking Japan in terms of aggregate GDP is a significant symbolic and economic milestone, the focus must now shift to per capita GDP — a measure of the average income and living standards of Indian citizens. \"As we celebrate, we must stay dissatisfied,\" the statement continued. \"India’s next leap must be in per capita income, not just surpassing Germany or other economies in nominal terms.\" To maintain momentum and ensure that growth is inclusive and sustainable, India must accelerate structural reforms in key areas: Governance and policy efficiency Manufacturing and job creation. Infrastructure development. Education and skill-building. Access to capital for startups and MSMEs. The sentiment is clear: India’s economic size is growing — but to truly empower every citizen, the country must now focus on quality, depth, and distribution of wealth. #indiaGDP #japanGDP #indiaVSjapan #IndianEconomy #perCapitaGDP #anandMahindra #businessLeaders #startupInsights #startupro 1,423 73 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook X Sanatan Rising 6mo Report this comment India should 1) Fix Pakistan for once. 2) Send back infiltrators by implementing NRC 3) Implement UCC and ONOC 4) Build walled business cities with intra visa system and Union territory status. 5) Introduce fair competition policy and save traditional business from online onslaught and accumulation of wealth in the hands of few.

      "full_content": "Synopsis India is now purportedly the world's fourth-largest economy, surpassing Japan, with a projected GDP of $4.187 billion by FY26. However, the reality on the ground, with infrastructure challenges and disparities in wealth distribution, doesn't reflect this economic status. Despite the official recognition, the benefits of this growth are not visibly trickling down to improve everyday life for many citizens. Just in Jest We just got the memo: India has become the 4th-largest economy in the world, with a projected GDP of $4.187 bn for FY26. We've also been told that India has surpassed Japan in the GDP stakes. But the way the thermometer says 30° C and yet it 'feels like' 48° C, why does it not feel like we're the 4th-biggest economy in the world? Look out of the window, and it doesn't seem viksit-y just yet. India could be the opposite of a 'Potemkin Village' - you know, a false facade named after the Russian military leader Grigory Potemkin, who allegedly erected fake villages during Empress Catherine the Great's visit to Crimea to make the region look more prosperous than it really was. In India's case, things look worse than they really may be. Potholes still resemble gurgly swirlpools after a good rain. Public hygiene and civic sense are still Fourth World-ish in certain places. Government offices still greet you with the timeless charm of a printer that hasn't worked since 1991. There's wealth, no doubt - just not the kind that trickles down but rather evaporates into gated communities. In real rich countries, even the wealthy step outdoors for a view or to mingle. Here, bubbles help. But let's make the best of what we have: the official stamp that after the US, China and Germany, India is in the posh line. So what if it doesn't feel like it?

He said that in just five years since Modi ji gave the clarion call for self-reliance in May 2020, India has risen to become the fourth largest economy in the world — a remarkable achievement born out of the collective strength and resolve of 140 crore Indians. City Air News Oct 12, 2025 05:52 0 Facebook Twitter Panchkula/Chandigarh, October 12, 2025: BJP National General Secretary Tarun Chugh today hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, saying that the dream of Atmanirbhar Bharat has now become a living reality. He said that in just five years since Modi ji gave the clarion call for self-reliance in May 2020, India has risen to become the fourth largest economy in the world — a remarkable achievement born out of the collective strength and resolve of 140 crore Indians. Speaking as the Chief Guest at the GST Bachat Mahotsav and Atmanirbhar Bharat Sammelan held at the PWD Rest House auditorium in Panchkula, Chugh said that Atmanirbhar Bharat was never a mere scheme, but a grand mission to secure India’s economic, cultural, and strategic independence. He recalled how, during the pandemic, India turned adversity into strength: “When we depended on foreign countries even for masks and PPE kits, within months India emerged as a leading global producer. This is the identity of self-reliance, the true strength of New India,” he said. Chugh underlined that under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, every sector has registered historic achievements. Electronics production has grown six times, mobile manufacturing has surged 28 times, defence exports have crossed Rs. 23,000 crore to more than 100 countries, and India has established itself as the pharmacy hub of the world. Renewable energy capacity has reached 234 GW, the semiconductor sector has attracted investments of Rs. 1.60 lakh crore, and Digital India has generated production worth Rs. 8.56 lakh crore with 1.35 lakh new jobs. “From Chandrayaan-3 to Operation Sindoor, from AI to green hydrogen, every milestone stands as proof of Modi ji’s vision,” Chugh said. He stressed that the double-engine government has ensured that Haryana too has become a strong pillar in this national journey. Farmers are being empowered with irrigation and crop insurance, MSMEs in auto, textiles, and agri-business are gaining new strength, and women and youth are being encouraged through self-help groups and startups. Chugh concluded by saying that the roadmap is clear: by 2030 India will be the third largest economy, by 2040 the second, and by 2047 a developed nation. “Atmanirbhar Bharat is not just a slogan, it is the truth of New India — a truth shaped by the labour and determination of 140 crore Indians,” he said. The event, presided over by Panchkula District President Ajay Mittal, saw the participation of State Vice President Banto Kataria, Kalka MLA Shakti Rani Sharma, Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal, former Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, campaign state co-convenor Preeti Johar, senior leader Shyamlal Bansal, Shivalik Board Vice Chairman Om Prakash Devnagar, District General Secretary Jai Kaushik, and constituency convenor K. Chandan, along with a large gathering of prominent traders, doctors, lawyers, educationists, and social workers. In his presidential address, Ajay Mittal welcomed all the dignitaries and announced that numerous awareness programs would be organized across Panchkula district under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Sankalp Abhiyan. He said BJP workers would personally meet traders to encourage the promotion of indigenous products. He further informed that a major convention of local workers, artisans, sculptors, handicraft industries, street vendors, and small shopkeepers will soon be held in Panchkula. It may be noted that BJP is organizing GST Bachat Mahotsav and Atmanirbhar Bharat Sammelans across the country at the assembly level, under which the Panchkula district organization has successfully conducted the program in both its constituencies.

The country’s GDP has touched the $4 trillion mark, placing it behind only the United States, China and Germany in size. Speaking after the 10th Governing Council meeting of the policy think tank, Subrahmanyam attributed the rise to a combination of domestic reforms and a global environment that is increasingly leaning in India’s favour. advertisement “As I speak, we are now the fourth-largest economy. We’ve reached a $4 trillion economy,” he told reporters, citing the latest IMF estimates to underscore India’s economic ascent. “Only the US, China and Germany are ahead of us. If we stick to our path, we could become the third-largest in just 2.5 to 3 years.” The milestone comes amid an evolving global economic landscape where India is positioning itself as a key alternative manufacturing hub. Subrahmanyam responded to recent remarks by former US President Donald Trump, who said iPhones sold in the US should be made domestically rather than in countries like India. “The specifics of future US tariffs remain unclear,” he said, “but India will continue to offer a cost-competitive manufacturing base regardless of those dynamics.” He also revealed that a fresh wave of asset monetisation initiatives is in the pipeline. The government is preparing a second round of its asset monetisation programme, expected to be rolled out in August. The economic milestone comes at a politically significant time, just as India looks to deepen its role in global supply chains and attract fresh investments under its ‘Make in India’ push. - Ends Published By: Atul Mishra Published On: May 25, 2025 Trending Reel Watch Live TV",

      "full_content": "NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani on Monday said India is set to become the fourth largest economy in the world by the end of 2025, an assertion which came days after NITI CEO BVR Subrahmanyam claimed India has already overtaken Japan to reach that spot. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) report released in April had said that India is expected to be the fourth largest economy in the world with a GDP of $4.19 trillion in 2025, ahead of Japan. \"India is in the process of becoming the fourth largest economy, and I am personally confident that will happen by the end of 2025 because we need (data) of all 12 months GDP to say that, you know, to assert that. \"So to say till then, it remains a forecast,\" Virmani told PTI. Asked to comment on NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam's remark that India has become the fourth largest economy in the world, the eminent economist said: \"So this is a complicated question, and I really do not know what the words anybody has used. \"Perhaps there was some word which was missed or something.\" Citing IMF data, Subrahmanyam, last week, said that the size of the Indian economy today is larger than Japan's. \"We are a $4 trillion economy as I speak,\" the NITI Aayog CEO had said. \"It is only the US, China and Germany which are larger than India, and if we stick to what is being planned and what is being thought through, in 2.5-3 years, we will be the third largest economy,\" Subrahmanyam had said. Explaining further, Virmani said, \"When we discuss the size of economies publicly, we generally use US dollar current prices.\" Virmani further pointed out that 'when we compare economy, we generally do it in terms of annual GDP'. Virmani said IMF in its WEO report released in April gave a precise number, which showed that India's GDP for the full year 2025, would become higher than that of Japan. \"I would say that I am pretty confident that that will happen, but the exact data will probably not be available till January or February, because we are talking about the whole year,\" he observed. India's nominal GDP for 2025 (FY26) is expected to be $4.187 trillion marginally more than the likely GDP of Japan which is estimated at $4.186 trillion, the IMF had said. According to IMF data, India's per capita income has doubled from $1,438 in 2013-14 to $2,880 in 2025. The IMF in its WEO report also said the Indian economy is projected to grow at 6.2 per cent in 2025-26, slower than earlier estimated rate of 6.5 per cent, due to escalated trade tensions and global uncertainty. \"For India, the growth outlook is relatively more stable at 6.2 per cent in 2025, supported by private consumption, particularly in rural areas,\" the IMF had said. According to the report, the global growth is projected at 2.8 per cent in 2025, lower by 0.5 percentage points estimated earlier. In 2026, the global economy is estimated to grow at 3 per cent.

NITI Aayog CEO B.V.R. Subrahmanyam said, India is now poised to displace Germany from the third rank in the next 2.5 to 3 years. Yesterday, briefing the media after tenth Governing Council Meeting of NITI Aayog in New Delhi, he said India is now a ‘four trillion dollar’ economy as per the IMF data. He said, it’s only the United States, China, and Germany’s economies which are larger than India. The IMF in its recent report has said that India will remain the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The IMF had stated earlier this month in the World Economic Outlook report that India continues to remain the world’s fastest-growing major economy and the only country expected to clock over 6 per cent growth in the next two years. According to the IMF, India’s GDP currently stands at 4.3 trillion dollar. India’s GDP was 2.1 trillion dollar in 2015, since then, the country has more than doubled its economy. According to the report, the high rate of growth will see India’s GDP increasing to 5.5 trillion dollar in 2028 overtaking Germany to become the third-largest economy. The IMF has projected a zero growth rate for Germany in 2025, followed by 0.9 per cent in 2026 as it is expected to be hit the hardest among the European countries due to the ongoing global trade war. The GDP of the US, the world’s largest economy, has been pegged at 30.5 trillion dollar for 2025, while that of China, the second biggest, is around 19.2 trillion dollars.",
